1
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:24,953
Jon Snow!

2
00:00:25,036 --> 00:00:27,453
Oh, my goodness, you're beautiful!

3
00:00:27,454 --> 00:00:32,524
_

4
00:00:46,244 --> 00:00:47,870
One more. One more time, look away.

5
00:00:47,953 --> 00:00:49,578
We love your style.

6
00:00:55,434 --> 00:00:59,037
_

7
00:00:59,038 --> 00:01:03,265
_

8
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,078
Sophie! Sophie!

9
00:01:10,161 --> 00:01:12,119
He's my screensaver on my phone!

10
00:01:12,203 --> 00:01:14,703
And Gwendoline, now smile here.

11
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,915
_

12
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:39,158
_

13
00:02:44,787 --> 00:02:47,078
Production.

14
00:02:47,161 --> 00:02:49,453
- Production, Anna speaking.
- Bear with me.

15
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:52,745
Well, we do have 24-hour
security at the Paint Hall.

16
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:02,495
Good morning.
Um, the Godswood working on Friday.

17
00:03:02,578 --> 00:03:07,286
We need to know exactly who
is going to attend, and who...

18
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,870
I'd like to get shots of you doing work.

19
00:03:09,953 --> 00:03:11,787
Oh, God. Doing my work.

20
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,620
Sure.

21
00:03:18,143 --> 00:03:22,244
That's my working, is putting on
one pair of glasses to the other pair.

22
00:03:22,328 --> 00:03:23,994
- Oh, God.
- Hi.

23
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,745
Steve didn't respond to us

24
00:03:25,828 --> 00:03:28,536
about the direwolves because
they can go pretty fast.

25
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,828
He says 30 miles per hour.

26
00:03:29,912 --> 00:03:32,870
Right, right, right, right, right. Okay.

27
00:03:32,953 --> 00:03:35,119
So it's our biggest season ever,

28
00:03:35,203 --> 00:03:37,787
there's a lot of decisions
that need to be made.

29
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,578
It's something simple like a wolf

30
00:03:39,662 --> 00:03:42,495
running with a guy, for us it means

31
00:03:42,578 --> 00:03:43,912
a 150-foot green screen

32
00:03:43,994 --> 00:03:46,370
with a tracking vehicle in Calgary.

33
00:03:46,453 --> 00:03:49,870
You know, it's fun.
It's a fun puzzle to figure out,

34
00:03:49,994 --> 00:03:52,244
you know,
and when you do figure it out it's...

35
00:03:52,328 --> 00:03:54,495
I think that's why I
used to love algebra,

36
00:03:54,578 --> 00:03:56,328
is that you'd figure out the equation,

37
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:58,536
when you got that answer
it was like, "Wow."

38
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,036
And so it's the same with this.
We keep messing with the puzzle,

39
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:04,828
and then when that last piece fits,

40
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,662
you're like, "Yeah, it worked."

41
00:04:09,495 --> 00:04:10,870
For you.

42
00:04:13,328 --> 00:04:18,161
My schedule ends up being...
It's, you know, very...

43
00:04:19,536 --> 00:04:21,745
and that's a simple one.

44
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:24,411
Like the Art Department,
they go horizontally,

45
00:04:24,495 --> 00:04:27,787
but I decided I want to go...
I go vertically.

46
00:04:29,495 --> 00:04:31,578
Do you thrive on all of this, Chris?

47
00:04:31,662 --> 00:04:34,453
Not particularly. What?

48
00:04:34,536 --> 00:04:36,453
It's all I've done since I left school,

49
00:04:36,536 --> 00:04:37,870
I don't know anything else.

50
00:04:43,411 --> 00:04:45,536
The way Game of Thrones is developed

51
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,286
is every episode has as much in it

52
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,994
as any one feature film,

53
00:04:50,078 --> 00:04:52,870
but we have to do it
quicker and for less money.

54
00:04:54,787 --> 00:04:58,161
All you can do with
any large operation is

55
00:04:58,244 --> 00:05:01,370
get the best people
around you and let them go.

56
00:05:08,203 --> 00:05:10,453
As we said,
we're trying to figure out how...

57
00:05:51,411 --> 00:05:53,328
This is our first day of fittings,

58
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:56,286
and we're just doing 25,
I think it is, today.

59
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,370
We have the same people,
like, every year.

60
00:05:58,453 --> 00:06:00,745
It's really nice,
they're like a little family.

61
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:02,870
They always kind of show up every year.

62
00:06:05,411 --> 00:06:07,161
- Keep you nice and warm.
- Mm.

63
00:06:07,787 --> 00:06:08,994
_

64
00:06:09,194 --> 00:06:10,799
_

65
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:12,699
_

66
00:06:12,703 --> 00:06:14,578
And he's obsessed with the whole show.

67
00:06:14,662 --> 00:06:17,161
It would be really cool
if youse got to meet him,

68
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:18,953
he'd be so excited.

69
00:06:19,036 --> 00:06:20,078
Hey, what?

70
00:06:20,161 --> 00:06:22,203
Thanks, Brad.

71
00:06:22,286 --> 00:06:23,495
Yeah, man.

72
00:06:23,578 --> 00:06:25,119
- Are you Andrew?
- I am.

73
00:06:25,203 --> 00:06:26,870
You're the person
I'm here to see. I'm Jeanie.

74
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:29,370
I'm making the documentary
about Game of Thrones.

75
00:06:29,453 --> 00:06:30,703
- Okay.
- For a whole year.

76
00:06:30,787 --> 00:06:32,161
- Okay.
- I was wondering

77
00:06:32,244 --> 00:06:33,703
if I could follow your fitting.

78
00:06:33,787 --> 00:06:35,411
Excellent.

79
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:44,161
- Hello, Rettie.
- If you could fill in that.

80
00:06:44,244 --> 00:06:46,953
- Thank you.
- And then I'll get...

81
00:06:47,036 --> 00:06:49,244
- Hello. How are you?
- Good to see you.

82
00:06:49,328 --> 00:06:52,036
- Are you all right?
- Nice to see you. We're excited.

83
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:54,036
- Hello.
- Are you all buzzed?

84
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:56,203
- I'm buzzed.
- You're all excited.

85
00:06:56,286 --> 00:06:59,244
Back in for the last season,
so I'm loving life.

86
00:07:03,161 --> 00:07:04,411
- Lovely.
- Yeah?

87
00:07:04,495 --> 00:07:06,328
Yeah. Snug...

88
00:07:07,578 --> 00:07:09,662
- Too snug?
- Do you want another pair?

89
00:07:09,745 --> 00:07:11,453
Could I try just a size bigger, Rach?

90
00:07:11,536 --> 00:07:14,578
Just so I can get my thermal socks on.
Cheers, eh.

91
00:07:14,662 --> 00:07:17,578
If I recall, the best way
into that's on your knees, yes?

92
00:07:17,662 --> 00:07:19,203
It's the easiest.

93
00:07:19,286 --> 00:07:21,453
- That's funny.
- We've got to work out

94
00:07:21,536 --> 00:07:23,828
- an easier way.
- I absolutely love it,

95
00:07:23,912 --> 00:07:25,912
it is the best thing I have ever seen.

96
00:07:25,994 --> 00:07:27,620
The stories, the characters.

97
00:07:27,703 --> 00:07:30,370
I read the books since I was about 13,

98
00:07:30,453 --> 00:07:31,787
absolutely brilliant.

99
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,078
Like, honored to be able to work on it.

100
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:36,620
Night King better recognize.

101
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,703
- How you doing?
- Ah, what about you?

102
00:07:38,787 --> 00:07:42,119
- What about you?
- Come here. What's happening?

103
00:07:42,203 --> 00:07:44,953
- How's it going?
- Aye, sweet. Look at me.

104
00:07:45,036 --> 00:07:46,703
- Back in armor.
- Big time.

105
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:50,620
You want me to do my
meanest look possible?

106
00:07:52,554 --> 00:07:53,620
That might be extreme.

107
00:07:53,703 --> 00:07:55,091
Really? You go.

108
00:07:57,703 --> 00:08:00,119
Okay, we'll get you out of that, then.

109
00:08:00,203 --> 00:08:02,411
Can I just...?

110
00:08:02,495 --> 00:08:04,994
All right, now you can take me out.

111
00:08:05,078 --> 00:08:07,495
So we get our cool
jackets done every year.

112
00:08:07,578 --> 00:08:10,370
This is for Season 7.
Adrian has one as well.

113
00:08:10,453 --> 00:08:13,286
A direwolf on the back,
"The North Remembers."

114
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,994
Stark there on the arm.

115
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,620
And the unit you worked with.

116
00:08:16,703 --> 00:08:19,411
So Dragon, Wolf, and White Walker units,

117
00:08:19,495 --> 00:08:21,286
so Dragon out of Belfast.

118
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,078
Whenever you see the season
starting back up again,

119
00:08:24,161 --> 00:08:26,328
you just see beards
and these black jackets

120
00:08:26,411 --> 00:08:28,078
walking around Belfast.

121
00:08:30,578 --> 00:08:32,203
_

122
00:08:35,101 --> 00:08:36,994
- _
- What's that?

123
00:08:37,078 --> 00:08:39,411
_

124
00:08:40,263 --> 00:08:41,996
_

125
00:08:42,672 --> 00:08:43,889
_

126
00:08:49,786 --> 00:08:53,786
_

127
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:08,203
I remember reading the script.
I remember being in Dubrovnik.

128
00:09:08,286 --> 00:09:09,578
And I remember saying to him,

129
00:09:09,662 --> 00:09:11,745
we're never gonna be
allowed to shoot here.

130
00:09:11,828 --> 00:09:13,244
Just knowing what we had to do.

131
00:09:13,328 --> 00:09:15,745
Nobody was going to let
them destroy their town,

132
00:09:15,828 --> 00:09:18,411
no matter where we were,
particularly not Dubrovnik.

133
00:09:18,495 --> 00:09:21,203
Then when we looked outside
of the production office,

134
00:09:21,286 --> 00:09:25,828
there's this great big,
flat piece of concreted land,

135
00:09:25,912 --> 00:09:28,036
you know,
the Titanic studios need a backlot,

136
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:31,703
and there was one really
obvious one sitting here.

137
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:32,704
_

138
00:09:33,703 --> 00:09:35,244
Phil and I are both scratching out

139
00:09:35,328 --> 00:09:37,578
different ideas for our
King's Landing street.

140
00:09:37,662 --> 00:09:41,703
We've been so many places and
photographed so many things

141
00:09:41,787 --> 00:09:43,286
that, uh...

142
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,870
it's actually trying to work out

143
00:09:44,953 --> 00:09:46,828
what makes these things fantastic.

144
00:09:46,912 --> 00:09:48,578
But it's gonna be a big build,

145
00:09:48,662 --> 00:09:49,703
so we need to make sure

146
00:09:49,787 --> 00:09:51,286
it's worth the money and time

147
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,912
that'll be invested.
Also they're not sacrificing

148
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:55,787
going to a location to,

149
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,411
instead,
be shooting in a really bad set.

150
00:09:58,495 --> 00:10:01,870
March 2013, when I first landed

151
00:10:01,953 --> 00:10:06,161
it was so daunting,
but at the same time,

152
00:10:06,244 --> 00:10:08,203
we just couldn't let ourselves fail.

153
00:10:08,286 --> 00:10:09,787
I don't have it so much anymore,

154
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,036
but I do, in the first year,
remember having

155
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:14,994
this constant tape in my head

156
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:17,203
of you are being employed to cope.

157
00:10:17,286 --> 00:10:19,536
Just cope, you just have to cope.

158
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,994
But now I realize all we were ever doing

159
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:27,453
in Seasons 4, 5, 6, and 7
were training for Season 8.

160
00:10:35,971 --> 00:10:38,493
_

161
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,286
We did have a fence
the whole way along here,

162
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,912
but unfortunately,
the winds knocked the fence down,

163
00:10:51,994 --> 00:10:54,536
so we'll have to get
a whole new fence in.

164
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,078
You don't want to spoil it for people,
you know?

165
00:10:57,161 --> 00:10:58,328
Because they'll see it.

166
00:10:58,411 --> 00:10:59,994
It will spoil it for me as well.

167
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:02,662
- Do you watch the show?
- Oh, God, I love it.

168
00:11:03,354 --> 00:11:04,536
_

169
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,636
Oh, I wouldn't know.

170
00:11:07,676 --> 00:11:08,711
I know nothing.

171
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:12,828
I'm really just looking for
a part in Game of Thrones.

172
00:11:12,912 --> 00:11:15,328
Put a word in there for me,
that would be great.

173
00:11:15,411 --> 00:11:18,912
One of the walking dead, that'll do me.

174
00:11:18,994 --> 00:11:21,495
I've got the baldy head for it.

175
00:11:23,913 --> 00:11:25,313
_

176
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,662
When did the cast get scripts?

177
00:11:31,745 --> 00:11:33,119
They've had them three days.

178
00:11:33,203 --> 00:11:36,036
I don't know who has
just read their parts

179
00:11:36,119 --> 00:11:38,286
and who's read the full things,

180
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,370
but they've had a little time with them.

181
00:11:40,453 --> 00:11:43,662
For some of them it might
be the first time they realize

182
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:46,620
that they die.
I know Kit hasn't read his.

183
00:11:46,703 --> 00:11:48,953
Yeah, if they've not read their more...

184
00:11:49,036 --> 00:11:51,036
You know,
because we've given them to them,

185
00:11:51,119 --> 00:11:54,244
it's up to them if they want
to read them before coming in.

186
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:05,845
Soup. Soup.

187
00:12:19,352 --> 00:12:22,601
_

188
00:12:29,994 --> 00:12:31,953
This is strange.

189
00:12:32,036 --> 00:12:35,078
We remember hoping against all hope

190
00:12:35,161 --> 00:12:37,745
that we would get our first table read

191
00:12:37,828 --> 00:12:40,578
for the first season,
here we are at the last one,

192
00:12:40,662 --> 00:12:42,078
and it really is...

193
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,703
It's like looking around a table

194
00:12:43,787 --> 00:12:46,620
and seeing your family, you know?

195
00:12:46,703 --> 00:12:49,328
- Except that we all get along.
- Way better looking.

196
00:12:55,828 --> 00:12:57,620
"Exterior, Winterfell Wall.

197
00:12:57,703 --> 00:12:59,286
"The battle for Winterfell begins,

198
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,620
heavily adapted, believe it or not,
for read through purposes."

"The Night King turns and
sees Jon coming for him.

"He takes more punishment

terrifying calm.

"He stops before Bran and
raises his sword to strike,

215
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:43,328

him out of the darkness. Arya."

"She vaults off a pile of dead wights,

She plunges the dagger

00:13:49,994 --> 00:13:53,036
through the Night King's armor,
and the Night King shatters."

00:13:57,286 --> 00:13:59,244
Maisie!

220
00:13:59,328 --> 00:14:02,328
"Wildlings and Northerners
have gathered around Jon."

221
00:14:02,411 --> 00:14:04,495
"I saw him riding that thing."

222
00:14:04,578 --> 00:14:06,620
- "We all did."
- "No, no.

223
00:14:06,703 --> 00:14:11,953
I saw him riding that thing."

224
00:14:13,244 --> 00:14:15,244
"That's right. You saw it."

225
00:14:15,328 --> 00:14:17,870
- "I did."
- "You did."

226
00:14:19,953 --> 00:14:22,244

agreed to follow him."

"Dragonstone Beach, night.

hands bound, down the beach."

happen if you betrayed me."

_

265
00:16:09,317 --> 00:16:10,411
So.

266
00:16:28,662 --> 00:16:30,370
Winter's coming, yeah.

267
00:16:30,453 --> 00:16:35,036
I am the snow man okay?
Leave it with me.

268
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:38,994
When they started on Season 1,
it was just one forest,

269
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:41,453
and 'cause this is the final season,

270
00:16:41,536 --> 00:16:44,119
then yeah,
everything seems to be a lot bigger

271
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:46,370
and heavier and more snow.

272
00:16:46,453 --> 00:16:49,662
It's just, uh, paper. Paper and water,

273
00:16:49,745 --> 00:16:51,370
and it does the job.

274
00:16:57,578 --> 00:17:01,536
You probably need to go into that,
uh, hay doober, Steve.

275
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,870
It's just trying to work out
where we need to put stuff

276
00:17:04,953 --> 00:17:06,286
and where we don't, you know?

277
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:09,036
You can go on and reckon
we're just seeing that,

278
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,328
but, you know,
you move the camera just an inch

279
00:17:11,411 --> 00:17:14,203
and it's another 10 meters
that you have to dress.

280
00:17:14,286 --> 00:17:16,703
You can't just throw money at things,
you know?

281
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:17,953
I'm a stickler for that.

282
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:19,953
I don't like to give
away too much money.

283
00:17:20,036 --> 00:17:22,703
I don't like to waste anything.
I know it's not mine,

284
00:17:22,787 --> 00:17:24,286
but don't waste it, you know?

285
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,370
What are you gonna do if it snows?

286
00:17:26,453 --> 00:17:28,370
If it snows? Oh, probably have a party.

287
00:17:28,453 --> 00:17:30,703
If it snows, yeah,
cover the whole lot in white.

288
00:17:30,787 --> 00:17:34,036
That would be fantastic.
But it's just not going to happen.

289
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,370
It just rains in Belfast.

290
00:17:38,953 --> 00:17:40,745
Must be Naomi there.

291
00:17:40,828 --> 00:17:42,370
If that's horse feed,

292
00:17:42,453 --> 00:17:44,703
it needs to come up to me
at the horse marquee.

293
00:17:44,787 --> 00:17:46,994
They're fucking lying everywhere.

294
00:17:47,078 --> 00:17:49,078
What the fuck are you talking about?

295
00:17:49,161 --> 00:17:51,870
They've been threw off.
They're lying everywhere.

296
00:17:51,953 --> 00:17:53,244
They came on a tipper

297
00:17:53,328 --> 00:17:55,203
so we just have to fucking tip them

298
00:17:55,286 --> 00:17:56,578
into the fucking grass.

299
00:17:56,662 --> 00:17:57,828
Yeah, no worries.

300
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:02,620
So I'm the location manager.

301
00:18:02,703 --> 00:18:05,286
You can have 350 crew,

302
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:09,244
and with that comes the infrastructure,

303
00:18:09,328 --> 00:18:13,994
service vehicles, extras, marquees.

304
00:18:14,078 --> 00:18:17,203
I sort of end up doing all the logistics

305
00:18:17,286 --> 00:18:19,745
and the running of all the locations

306
00:18:19,828 --> 00:18:22,994
when we're out and about,
which is great fun.

307
00:18:28,703 --> 00:18:31,453
We'll have to use our
imagination a little bit.

308
00:18:31,536 --> 00:18:36,411
- This 25-by-50 meter is extras holding.
- _

309
00:18:36,495 --> 00:18:39,453
We have to avoid this manhole cover,

310
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:41,286
so when you bring the crowd up,

311
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,620
the door to the crowd
holding will be here.

312
00:18:45,703 --> 00:18:49,828
The only problem is
these big gas canisters,

313
00:18:49,912 --> 00:18:52,370
that's all propane. You cannot sit there

314
00:18:52,453 --> 00:18:55,328
having a fag, otherwise
the whole thing's gonna go up.

315
00:18:55,329 --> 00:18:57,961
_

316
00:18:57,962 --> 00:18:59,162
_

317
00:18:59,203 --> 00:19:02,453
That's an electric fence,
so they'll not be tempted

318
00:19:02,536 --> 00:19:05,119
to dander up past the electric fence.

319
00:19:05,203 --> 00:19:06,119
_

320
00:19:06,203 --> 00:19:07,261
Yeah.

321
00:19:17,093 --> 00:19:19,161
We've got caltrops
in place where they're gonna be,

322
00:19:19,244 --> 00:19:21,411
so we can, um, hide them for the switch.

323
00:19:25,578 --> 00:19:27,578
We just then... They...

324
00:19:34,078 --> 00:19:36,411
I need to go a little bit higher.

325
00:19:36,495 --> 00:19:39,119
I can see the legs and the heads.

326
00:19:39,203 --> 00:19:42,662
But actually want to see them...
how they jump.

327
00:19:42,745 --> 00:19:45,161
- Just adjust.
- And then watch it,

328
00:19:45,244 --> 00:19:47,495
- you can see the...
- I've said to the guys

329
00:19:47,578 --> 00:19:49,953
the thing that they should
focus on is planning

330
00:19:50,036 --> 00:19:53,119
where they're going and making sure
they all miss each other.

331
00:19:53,203 --> 00:19:55,036
Let's put caltrops in front of caltrops.

332
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:57,286
So you create much more
of a barrier, yeah?

333
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,828
Three, two, one, action!

334
00:20:10,411 --> 00:20:12,036
Cut. Good.

335
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:13,441
Action!

336
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,703
No!

337
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,703
One. Action!

338
00:20:22,411 --> 00:20:24,703
It's about choreographing the fights

339
00:20:24,787 --> 00:20:25,953
with Ratsa and Vlad.

340
00:20:26,036 --> 00:20:28,286
It's basically what we do on film set.

341
00:20:29,953 --> 00:20:32,787
It's what we do on a film set,
we just do it in a tent.

342
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:35,953
I think they kill him, and kill him...

343
00:20:37,578 --> 00:20:40,036
By the time we come to shoot it,

344
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:42,036
the producers know what the fight is,

345
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:44,119
the director knows, the actors know.

346
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:45,870
Everybody knows what's going on.

347
00:20:47,703 --> 00:20:51,119
This is one we did yesterday.
This is like the end.

348
00:21:15,787 --> 00:21:17,286
So each hero moment

349
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,036
we do something like that for.

350
00:21:29,953 --> 00:21:32,994
There's a moment here where
you do the two of them meet.

351
00:21:33,078 --> 00:21:35,119
So why don't you... Riley?

352
00:21:35,203 --> 00:21:38,036
Take that light back a bit,
and we'll take a photograph

353
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:39,119
of these fine people.

354
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:43,036
And hit that, good.

355
00:21:45,828 --> 00:21:47,244
Okay, good. Thank you.

356
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:49,578
I've been brought in this season

357
00:21:49,662 --> 00:21:51,745
to introduce Episodes 1, 2, and 4

358
00:21:51,828 --> 00:21:53,994
to the throng out there
that have been waiting

359
00:21:54,078 --> 00:21:56,328
to see the final season
of Game of Thrones.

360
00:21:56,411 --> 00:21:57,870
I'm getting into the consequences

361
00:21:57,953 --> 00:21:59,994
of what happens to
people in their lives,

362
00:22:00,078 --> 00:22:01,370
the war that's coming,

363
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:03,994
and of course how that affects people.

364
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:06,203
_

365
00:22:06,982 --> 00:22:09,505
_

366
00:22:09,705 --> 00:22:12,560
_

367
00:22:13,268 --> 00:22:17,883
_

368
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,203
Okay.

369
00:22:19,286 --> 00:22:22,078
Thanks, we'll be in touch. Thanks.

370
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:28,953
He breaks down his scripts,
which I help him do.

371
00:22:29,036 --> 00:22:31,620
He gets floor plans
printed out that he cuts up

372
00:22:31,703 --> 00:22:35,828
and then blocks out where
the characters are gonna go,

373
00:22:35,912 --> 00:22:38,411
where they move to,
where the camera's gonna go.

374
00:22:38,495 --> 00:22:40,912
And it's a little road map
for the whole scene.

375
00:22:40,994 --> 00:22:42,536
He draws it all by hand,

376
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,078
and he likes it on
U.S. letter-size paper,

377
00:22:45,161 --> 00:22:47,828
which is like 8 1/2 by 11, I think.

378
00:22:47,912 --> 00:22:49,745
- Not A4?
- No, he doesn't...

379
00:22:49,828 --> 00:22:51,203
A4, it doesn't work.

380
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:55,370
So we shipped over a big
box of goldenrod paper.

381
00:22:55,453 --> 00:22:56,953
Why does A4 not work?

382
00:22:58,436 --> 00:23:00,620
Don't question the system.

383
00:23:01,828 --> 00:23:04,370
This is my nemesis, this copy machine.

384
00:23:13,536 --> 00:23:15,119
It's upside down.

385
00:23:19,572 --> 00:23:22,244
He is one of the few people
on the show that has printed scripts.

386
00:23:22,328 --> 00:23:24,244
They were trying to go
all digital this year,

387
00:23:24,328 --> 00:23:25,870
have everything on iPads,

388
00:23:25,953 --> 00:23:27,994
but that's just not how he rolls.

389
00:23:28,078 --> 00:23:30,953
He claims he's a Luddite,
but, you know, he's done

390
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:32,953
some of the most iconic episodes.

391
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:35,953
He did the Red Wedding
and the Walk of Shame.

392
00:23:37,495 --> 00:23:39,870
What is that a drawing of,
on the top there?

393
00:23:39,953 --> 00:23:42,912
That's a dead Theon,
and that's Sansa overtop of him.

394
00:23:42,994 --> 00:23:45,828
- On your special paper.
- On my special paper.

395
00:23:45,912 --> 00:23:48,203
How long have you used this process?

396
00:23:48,286 --> 00:23:50,036
Since the very beginning.

397
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:53,161
- Did someone teach you...?
- I taught myself.

398
00:23:53,244 --> 00:23:55,036
This is my method.

399
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:56,411
My methodology.

400
00:23:56,495 --> 00:23:58,078
My stuff goes in that safe there,

401
00:23:58,161 --> 00:23:59,370
nothing gets left out.

402
00:23:59,453 --> 00:24:01,453
If you touch the paper at the wrong time

403
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,787
it will dissolve like Mission Impossible

404
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,620
and burn up.

405
00:24:16,703 --> 00:24:19,161
We're doing it tomorrow.

406
00:24:20,286 --> 00:24:22,662
It needs to be up here.

407
00:24:25,356 --> 00:24:28,592
_

408
00:24:38,411 --> 00:24:41,036
It is, well,

409
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:44,203
just 20 past 4, yeah.

410
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:49,119
So yeah, those 4 or 5:00 starts
are quite regular.

411
00:24:49,203 --> 00:24:51,495
I think half past 3
has been the earliest,

412
00:24:51,578 --> 00:24:53,828
when we were in Morocco.

413
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,662
Cheers, all right.

414
00:24:57,745 --> 00:25:00,078
- Good morning, darling.
- Hi.

415
00:25:00,161 --> 00:25:01,912
- How are you?
- All right.

416
00:25:01,994 --> 00:25:04,328
Emilia's generally got dark hair,

417
00:25:04,411 --> 00:25:08,662
so when you put the wig on,
it looks like it's got roots.

418
00:25:08,745 --> 00:25:10,370
This is the sexy bit.

419
00:25:10,453 --> 00:25:12,328
So we have to put a little cap over

420
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:14,578
that kills any dark.

421
00:25:14,662 --> 00:25:16,662
I don't think anyone
knows it's this much work.

422
00:25:16,745 --> 00:25:21,662
No. Also this is very lucky,
to see this bit.

423
00:25:21,745 --> 00:25:23,912
This is normally when
someone like a producer

424
00:25:23,994 --> 00:25:26,286
knocks on the door
and you're like, "Not now!"

425
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:28,662
Please, don't come in.

426
00:25:30,244 --> 00:25:32,078
Gilly's gone glamorous.

427
00:25:32,161 --> 00:25:35,411
Ooh. She has. Looks very nice.

428
00:25:36,616 --> 00:25:38,286
A weekend look.

429
00:25:39,078 --> 00:25:40,798
_

430
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,953
_

431
00:25:44,153 --> 00:25:47,428
_

432
00:25:47,628 --> 00:25:52,161
No, it is, because that is
still the most beautiful hair

433
00:25:52,244 --> 00:25:55,286
I will ever have on my head, ever.

434
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:57,654
It's magical.

435
00:25:57,689 --> 00:26:03,787
When you put that on,
it's just an instant whoa.

436
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:06,703
- There she is.
- Oh my God, there she is.

437
00:26:15,828 --> 00:26:17,119
My heart is in my throat

438
00:26:17,203 --> 00:26:21,620
when I think about this
not happening much longer.

439
00:26:21,703 --> 00:26:22,828
Putting this on. It gets...

440
00:26:22,912 --> 00:26:24,703
Genuinely gets me really, like...

441
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:40,912
Look at that. Beautiful.
Rhiannon did all of this.

442
00:26:40,994 --> 00:26:42,994
These beautiful illuminated scripts.

443
00:26:43,078 --> 00:26:45,411
And then the magic's over again.

444
00:26:45,495 --> 00:26:46,994
It was beautiful.

445
00:26:47,078 --> 00:26:49,244
It's a simple enough scene, no?

446
00:26:49,328 --> 00:26:51,620
Yeah, yeah. It's a great start.

447
00:26:51,703 --> 00:26:53,286
Everybody's like, "Oh, I'm so happy

448
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:56,578
this is how we're starting."
And so it's perfect.

449
00:26:56,662 --> 00:26:59,078
And he's so excited to be here,

450
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:02,036
which is so sweet too.
That he's, like, thanking me.

451
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:04,453
No, I'm thanking you.
No, I'm thanking you.

452
00:27:04,536 --> 00:27:05,595
So yeah.

453
00:27:05,795 --> 00:27:09,395
_

454
00:27:09,453 --> 00:27:12,536
I know, he's just so excited
that he got to do...

455
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:16,328
And to do three,
50 percent of the final season.

456
00:27:16,411 --> 00:27:18,411
He does that...
I call it the penguin walk,

457
00:27:18,495 --> 00:27:20,286
it's like, "Oh, the penguin's released."

458
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,953
Good morning. If we could give David

459
00:27:23,036 --> 00:27:26,078
a little privacy for this first
rehearsal please? Thank you.

460
00:27:26,161 --> 00:27:27,286
Here we go.

461
00:27:31,578 --> 00:27:33,495
If it's not too much trouble,

462
00:27:33,578 --> 00:27:35,161
I could use a pardon.

463
00:27:35,244 --> 00:27:36,953
For what crime?

464
00:27:37,036 --> 00:27:40,953
I borrowed a few books from the Citadel.

465
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:43,036
I love me some Dragon Queen.

466
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,370
I love Daenerys. I love dragons.

467
00:27:45,453 --> 00:27:48,078
I would hope that I
would be a Targaryen,

468
00:27:48,161 --> 00:27:51,994
minus the whole are they crazy,
are they not crazy,

469
00:27:52,078 --> 00:27:53,787
the incest thing and all that stuff.

470
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:56,119
But, um, being able to go from,

471
00:27:56,203 --> 00:27:58,620
you know, waiting
and watching it on my couch

472
00:27:58,703 --> 00:28:01,161
to then being on the set
when they're shooting

473
00:28:01,244 --> 00:28:03,286
the final season,
it's been kind of surreal.

474
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:05,453
Do we need to let you go do your job?

475
00:28:05,536 --> 00:28:08,495
It would be good.
I'm going to bring him almonds,

476
00:28:08,578 --> 00:28:11,536
which will be very good.
Protein, fuel him on set,

477
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,620
make sure he's got everything going.

478
00:28:13,703 --> 00:28:15,578
I'm like his stamina elf.

479
00:28:22,161 --> 00:28:24,286
- Almonds?
- Thank you.

480
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,703
Do you want any yang herbs?

481
00:28:32,787 --> 00:28:35,662
- Oh, yes, yes.
- Okay, yeah, I'll go get it.

482
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:39,453
And roll sound, please.

483
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:42,953
Thirty-nine Apple, take one.

484
00:28:43,036 --> 00:28:45,536
Quiet on the set.

485
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,036
First shot of the last season.

486
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:49,386
And...

487
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,286
- Set.
- Set.

488
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,536
Action.

489
00:28:56,953 --> 00:28:58,328
Your Grace.

490
00:28:58,411 --> 00:29:00,578
Your brother stood with your father.

491
00:29:00,662 --> 00:29:03,828
I offered to let him
retain his lands and titles

492
00:29:03,912 --> 00:29:07,328
if he bent the knee. He refused.

493
00:29:07,411 --> 00:29:12,328
Um, thank you,
Your Grace, for telling me.

494
00:29:12,411 --> 00:29:13,703
May I?

495
00:29:13,787 --> 00:29:15,703
Of course.

496
00:29:20,536 --> 00:29:22,411
Cut there.

497
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,953
Basically it's
called the heart attack van.

498
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:33,953
We just follow them 'round everywhere.

499
00:29:34,036 --> 00:29:35,453
We tried to do healthy stuff,

500
00:29:35,536 --> 00:29:37,912
but they like things
that'll keep them going.

501
00:29:37,994 --> 00:29:41,203
The tiger toast thing
started just one day

502
00:29:41,286 --> 00:29:43,703
whenever I was feeling
a bit peckish myself

503
00:29:43,787 --> 00:29:45,870
when I was in Tesco's doing my shopping.

504
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:49,119
I thought I'll go buy a tiger
loaf and have a wee toastie,

505
00:29:49,203 --> 00:29:51,787
and I made it fully loaded
like this for myself.

506
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:53,703
One of the guys happened to notice it

507
00:29:53,787 --> 00:29:55,286
and went, "What are you making?"

508
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:56,787
"Making myself a wee toastie."

509
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,244
He says, "Can I have one?"

510
00:29:58,328 --> 00:30:00,912
Next thing everybody was coming,
"Can I have one?"

511
00:30:00,994 --> 00:30:03,411
And now it's one of the
most popular things here.

512
00:30:03,495 --> 00:30:05,912
Bacon, chicken, cheese,
ham, tomato, onion,

513
00:30:05,994 --> 00:30:07,953
tobacco onions, on the big tiger bread.

514
00:30:08,036 --> 00:30:09,953
- Hello.
- How are you?

515
00:30:10,036 --> 00:30:11,953
- What's the crack?
- Not much.

516
00:30:12,036 --> 00:30:13,994
- Good. Wee toastie?
- Yeah.

517
00:30:15,255 --> 00:30:16,328
What sauce would you like on yours?

518
00:30:17,545 --> 00:30:19,078
Thanks very much, see you later.

519
00:30:19,161 --> 00:30:20,662
Thank you.

520
00:30:20,745 --> 00:30:22,411
What are you doing today?

521
00:30:22,495 --> 00:30:24,912
Jaime Lannister trousers.

522
00:30:50,411 --> 00:30:53,161
A little bit of infection
in your wounds, perhaps.

523
00:30:53,244 --> 00:30:54,244
Oh, yeah.

524
00:30:58,187 --> 00:30:59,278
See you later, Rory.

525
00:31:00,286 --> 00:31:01,620
See you in a bit.

526
00:31:03,912 --> 00:31:07,620
Three, two, one, action.

527
00:31:26,662 --> 00:31:28,536
No way.

528
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,953
It's a flaming Dothraki arakh.

529
00:31:35,953 --> 00:31:37,078
_

530
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:38,119
_

531
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,120
_

532
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:41,787
Ding dong, look at that.

533
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:45,078
Is there a camera crew behind us?

534
00:31:45,161 --> 00:31:46,203
No.

535
00:31:46,286 --> 00:31:48,703
Three, two,

536
00:31:48,787 --> 00:31:50,370
one, go.

537
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:55,370
_

538
00:31:59,328 --> 00:32:03,994
Right, come on, you, down here quickly.

539
00:32:12,913 --> 00:32:14,620
You taught me how to park the sausages.

540
00:32:14,703 --> 00:32:18,244
Park your sausages,
park your fucking sausages.

541
00:32:18,328 --> 00:32:20,161
She teaches how to park the sausages.

542
00:32:20,244 --> 00:32:22,203
That's a big fucking gap.

543
00:32:22,286 --> 00:32:24,745
That's a cheap fucking sausage.

544
00:32:26,036 --> 00:32:27,578
First of the last?

545
00:32:27,662 --> 00:32:33,453
The first of the last
get-ins of Game of Thrones.

546
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:36,411
Does that not bring a
wee tear to your eye?

547
00:32:36,495 --> 00:32:38,870
- No.
- All right, fine, okay.

548
00:32:38,953 --> 00:32:40,370
Fucking bastard.

549
00:32:40,453 --> 00:32:43,536
Not like I haven't fucking
stood there wasting my life,

550
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:48,370
waiting on you fucking getting
to your fucking unit base...

551
00:32:50,019 --> 00:32:52,985
...for the past seven years.

552
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,119
I'm going to be crying next
year because I'm unemployed.

553
00:33:06,828 --> 00:33:08,953
Thank you very much.

554
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:16,161
Today we're doing crypt wights.

555
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:19,078
These wights are mummified.

556
00:33:21,787 --> 00:33:23,328
We're a bit nervous about today

557
00:33:23,411 --> 00:33:26,953
because it's the first time
we've done this style of wight.

558
00:33:27,036 --> 00:33:29,411
What are you nervous about?

559
00:33:29,495 --> 00:33:31,328
Uh, that everybody likes them.

560
00:33:33,953 --> 00:33:36,662
They're doing a proper
lighting test. I don't know.

561
00:33:36,745 --> 00:33:38,036
I do believe so.

562
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:40,161
And David and Dan are coming.

563
00:33:40,244 --> 00:33:41,703
Dave and Dan are here,

564
00:33:41,787 --> 00:33:44,244
so they will, most likely,
be popping in, I imagine.

565
00:33:44,328 --> 00:33:47,787
So did you just set up
and pitch to Game of Thrones?

566
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:49,953
- Did they come and offer you...?
- No.

567
00:33:50,036 --> 00:33:52,703
No, what happened
was Barrie's always worked

568
00:33:52,787 --> 00:33:54,244
for other prosthetic artists.

569
00:33:54,328 --> 00:33:57,119
- Okay.
- I'd done visual effects.

570
00:33:57,203 --> 00:33:59,370
Barrie said, "I think they're interested

571
00:33:59,453 --> 00:34:03,328
in a few people quoting
on Game of Thrones."

572
00:34:03,411 --> 00:34:05,703
And so Barrie and I were like:

573
00:34:05,787 --> 00:34:08,370
"Let's see what happens."
You know, da-da-da.

574
00:34:08,453 --> 00:34:11,411
We did our little spreadsheet,
and working everything out.

575
00:34:11,495 --> 00:34:13,994
Then Barrie got the phone call

576
00:34:14,078 --> 00:34:18,328
to say that we'd won it,
and we shat ourselves.

577
00:34:18,411 --> 00:34:20,953
We didn't have a workshop.
We didn't have crew.

578
00:34:21,036 --> 00:34:23,203
We didn't even have tables.
We had nothing.

579
00:34:23,286 --> 00:34:24,495
Okay.

580
00:34:28,078 --> 00:34:29,078
Hey, Leigh.

581
00:34:29,161 --> 00:34:30,411
- Hey.
- Hey.

582
00:34:30,495 --> 00:34:34,036
We just had, um, Leigh Maddern over here

583
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:37,453
to try the stump, for...

584
00:34:37,536 --> 00:34:40,828
Leigh, the stuntman,
uh, for the severed...

585
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,453
For the severed arm.

586
00:34:42,536 --> 00:34:45,036
And do you remember David Nutter said

587
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,994
they'd make sure that the character

588
00:34:47,078 --> 00:34:48,870
would have their sleeves rolled up.

589
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:50,536
So the issue is

590
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:54,453
Leigh says the characters
are wearing long-sleeved,

591
00:34:54,536 --> 00:34:57,411
thick jackets, which means

592
00:34:57,495 --> 00:35:00,286
that really you can't
do a severed arm gag

593
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:02,703
'cause it'll look stupid.

594
00:35:02,787 --> 00:35:04,828
You know, that's the gag, you're like...

595
00:35:08,177 --> 00:35:09,953
Can you scratch my nose?

596
00:35:10,036 --> 00:35:12,328
All we've got to do is try on the jacket

597
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:13,994
make sure I can pull the sleeve up.

598
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:16,203
If I can pull the sleeve up,
its happy days,

599
00:35:16,286 --> 00:35:18,411
- if I can't, we'll rethink.
- Not happy days.

600
00:35:18,495 --> 00:35:20,203
Then have a rethink.

601
00:35:20,286 --> 00:35:23,036
They'll say it's more
important to go for the crypt.

602
00:35:24,745 --> 00:35:28,161
If you cut through there and there,

603
00:35:28,244 --> 00:35:33,078
it's never going to go through...
A sword would never.

604
00:35:33,161 --> 00:35:34,994
It would never.

605
00:35:35,078 --> 00:35:38,620
Oh, that might be all right.

606
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:40,286
It seems horribly convenient

607
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:41,787
he's got his sleeves rolled up

608
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,662
ready to have his arm chopped off.

609
00:35:43,949 --> 00:35:45,546
_

610
00:35:45,581 --> 00:35:48,620
I feel like he could have
a few gold chains or something.

611
00:35:48,703 --> 00:35:50,703
If they're all having their pints...

612
00:35:50,787 --> 00:35:52,286
Hey!

613
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:54,244
Aah! Ha-ha-ha.

614
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:57,244
Thank you for doing that.

615
00:36:00,203 --> 00:36:02,495
Do you know how I get to Cell 4?

616
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:03,870
Oh, um...

617
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:05,286
Down there?

618
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:07,161
Right through there, take a left.

619
00:36:07,244 --> 00:36:08,536
- Yeah.
- It's right outside.

620
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,578
Okay, thank you.

621
00:36:11,912 --> 00:36:14,161
Don't follow me getting lost.

622
00:36:14,244 --> 00:36:15,703
Shit.

623
00:36:17,787 --> 00:36:19,787
Damn it.

624
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:21,411
Cell 2.

625
00:36:22,787 --> 00:36:27,078
It's hard when you work
so hard on something

626
00:36:27,161 --> 00:36:28,828
and you want everyone to like it,

627
00:36:28,912 --> 00:36:33,244
so I'm hoping they'll be like,
"Yeah, you nailed it!

628
00:36:33,328 --> 00:36:34,411
High-five!"

629
00:36:35,683 --> 00:36:36,934
Has anyone said anything?

630
00:36:36,969 --> 00:36:39,370
- Nobody's seen anything.
- Nobody's seen anything.

631
00:36:39,453 --> 00:36:41,411
- No.
- I'm excited for these.

632
00:36:41,495 --> 00:36:44,828
I really hope everyone's
gonna like them.

633
00:36:44,912 --> 00:36:47,703
I think Dave and Dan are about to come.

634
00:36:47,787 --> 00:36:50,411
Yeah, come on ahead, come on ahead.

635
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:55,370
I can't really tell what they think.

636
00:36:55,453 --> 00:36:57,994
I wanted a big round of applause.

637
00:36:58,078 --> 00:37:00,453
I can't really tell what they think.

638
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:05,328
_

639
00:37:05,411 --> 00:37:08,244
In terms of the makeup,
I think they're happy.

640
00:37:08,328 --> 00:37:11,370
But, um, they're gonna send
the pictures to Miguel,

641
00:37:11,453 --> 00:37:13,620
Miguel's gonna make notes,
go through them with David and Dan.

642
00:37:13,703 --> 00:37:15,453
We're going to have a meeting tomorrow

643
00:37:15,536 --> 00:37:19,912
to run through all library
and crypt, so, you know.

644
00:37:19,994 --> 00:37:21,161
But it wasn't a disaster.

645
00:37:23,745 --> 00:37:25,578
Today's final. Ha, ha.

646
00:37:25,662 --> 00:37:26,828
Ta-da!

647
00:37:43,466 --> 00:37:46,188
_

648
00:37:54,703 --> 00:37:56,953
Just little squirts every now and again

649
00:37:57,036 --> 00:37:59,370
for bits that needs to go over.

650
00:37:59,453 --> 00:38:01,620
The way this battle is gonna work

651
00:38:01,703 --> 00:38:03,119
is this show has been about

652
00:38:03,203 --> 00:38:04,411
that people don't get on.

653
00:38:04,495 --> 00:38:06,286
Now they finally find a way to get on.

654
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:08,244
You got the North with the wildlings.

655
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:11,953
So they all come together
and then somebody fucks up.

656
00:38:12,036 --> 00:38:13,745
Fucking gloves have shrunk.

657
00:38:13,828 --> 00:38:17,870
You, Jack and Glen go in
and see sweet cheeks

658
00:38:17,953 --> 00:38:21,578
and do the dressing in there,
ready for the first shot.

659
00:38:37,763 --> 00:38:40,078
I think it's mainly that bit back there.

660
00:38:40,161 --> 00:38:42,078
Yeah, that's the bit I can see.

661
00:38:42,161 --> 00:38:46,036
It's definitely tire tracks and that,
car tracks.

662
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:48,119
I think that'll do it,
then, I don't think

663
00:38:48,203 --> 00:38:51,328
they'll see much further than that.

664
00:38:52,226 --> 00:38:53,328
All you guys

665
00:38:53,411 --> 00:38:56,161
that made it, you're going
to survive to the big battle.

666
00:38:56,244 --> 00:38:58,536
Except the 10 guys in
the back are gonna die.

667
00:39:00,286 --> 00:39:02,953
We're going to do
a lot of running tonight.

668
00:39:03,036 --> 00:39:05,328
Just a bit of blue roll, please.

669
00:39:07,787 --> 00:39:10,078
Just a little bit. One sheet, one sheet.

670
00:39:10,161 --> 00:39:11,620
Don't waste it.

671
00:39:11,703 --> 00:39:15,662
Nine, eight, seven, six,

672
00:39:15,745 --> 00:39:21,578
five, four, three, two, one, action.

673
00:39:29,912 --> 00:39:32,828
Go have a look at the lasagna,
see what it looks like.

674
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:35,370
If it looks a bit skanky,
I'll have the chicken.

675
00:39:35,453 --> 00:39:36,745
Or maybe just have both

676
00:39:36,828 --> 00:39:39,328
and take some home for fucking dinner.

677
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,869
_

678
00:39:51,036 --> 00:39:55,203
I think one of the things
to take into this...

679
00:39:55,286 --> 00:39:59,953
Let's do the whole scene as
if you both got stomachache.

680
00:40:00,036 --> 00:40:01,411
- Okay.
- Mm-hm.

681
00:40:01,495 --> 00:40:03,119
Okay. Because also,

682
00:40:03,203 --> 00:40:05,870
is this the first time
you've seen a wight, as well?

683
00:40:05,953 --> 00:40:07,036
This is the first time

684
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,244
- I'm seeing them.
- Yeah.

685
00:40:08,328 --> 00:40:09,912
We've been prepping and prepping

686
00:40:09,994 --> 00:40:11,411
but really we don't know shit.

687
00:40:11,495 --> 00:40:12,912
I think the whole point, though,

688
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:15,244
of this is it's not about...
You can't see them.

689
00:40:15,328 --> 00:40:17,453
- It's the suspense of it.
- Yeah. I think so.

690
00:40:17,536 --> 00:40:19,370
That's what it is.
That's what I'm saying, the stomachache,

691
00:40:19,453 --> 00:40:21,411
it's uncomfortable
because you can't see.

692
00:40:21,495 --> 00:40:22,912
You don't have the information.

693
00:40:22,994 --> 00:40:25,036
- Yeah.
- Let's do it again

694
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,286
up to that point.

695
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:28,662
Then we'll work through
the next section.

696
00:40:28,745 --> 00:40:30,662
Set, and action.

697
00:40:31,769 --> 00:40:34,578
And the dragons pass over you.

698
00:40:34,662 --> 00:40:36,495
And off they go.

699
00:40:36,578 --> 00:40:38,328
And they bank left,

700
00:40:38,411 --> 00:40:40,662
they get further and further away.

701
00:40:40,745 --> 00:40:43,994
That light's slowly disappearing.

702
00:40:44,078 --> 00:40:45,620
And now there are none.

703
00:40:45,703 --> 00:40:48,036
But what you can hear

704
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:50,370
is a very, very low rumble.

705
00:40:52,203 --> 00:40:54,870
Episode 3 is a battle
from start to finish

706
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:58,286
and has three dialogue scenes in it,
and that's it.

707
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:01,328
Like, if you took Battle of
the Bastards into Hardhome

708
00:41:01,411 --> 00:41:04,453
to the Loot Train,
if you put all those three together

709
00:41:04,536 --> 00:41:07,244
that's probably the
size of this episode.

710
00:41:08,912 --> 00:41:10,703
I feel tired and cold,

711
00:41:10,787 --> 00:41:12,828
really not particularly in the mood

712
00:41:12,912 --> 00:41:17,536
to go and do a long 11
weeks of night shoots.

713
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:22,161
I don't really want
to spend 55 nights up.

714
00:41:23,578 --> 00:41:26,411
Uh, it's David and Dan's fault, mainly.

715
00:41:26,495 --> 00:41:28,495
Basically.

716
00:41:28,578 --> 00:41:32,286
'Cause they wanted to
do something bigger.

717
00:41:34,578 --> 00:41:36,203
Was today a good day?

718
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:37,787
Yeah, I think so. Probably.

719
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:43,203
I mean, we finished it on
time and didn't fuck it up.

720
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:54,016
_

721
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:19,953
Acting, acting, acting,

722
00:42:20,036 --> 00:42:23,078
and with the last one,
you need to be already,

723
00:42:23,161 --> 00:42:24,286
on your position.

724
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:27,578
One, two, three.

725
00:42:27,662 --> 00:42:29,036
Good.

726
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:31,495
One hit, hit, drop, pull.

727
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:34,328
Big smash. Okay, good.

728
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:38,286
_

729
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,731
_

730
00:42:42,529 --> 00:42:44,945
_

731
00:42:45,709 --> 00:42:48,095
_

732
00:42:48,375 --> 00:42:50,513
_

733
00:42:50,514 --> 00:42:52,853
_

734
00:42:53,338 --> 00:42:54,777
_

735
00:42:54,938 --> 00:42:56,947
_

736
00:42:56,948 --> 00:43:00,312
_

737
00:43:00,799 --> 00:43:02,158
_

738
00:43:04,745 --> 00:43:06,286
Now I'm in the front line,

739
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:10,994
so I'm like, "Wow, what I'm doing here?"

740
00:43:11,078 --> 00:43:13,328
Why...? Why me?

741
00:43:33,536 --> 00:43:35,787
I grow up in Czechoslovakia.

742
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:38,787
After the revolution, many of my friends

743
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:41,620
became part of the bad boy.

744
00:43:41,703 --> 00:43:45,703
I was 14, 15, and I had decision.

745
00:43:45,787 --> 00:43:48,495
Go with them to be gangster,

746
00:43:48,578 --> 00:43:50,203
or be with a live show.

747
00:43:50,286 --> 00:43:52,953
So when I decided to stay with the show,

748
00:43:53,036 --> 00:43:57,328
it was good because many
of my friends are dead already.

749
00:44:06,411 --> 00:44:08,787
The mask completely changes you.

750
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:12,870
You're stepping in the
makeup trailer joking,

751
00:44:12,953 --> 00:44:14,828
you know, and happy, and step-by-step,

752
00:44:14,912 --> 00:44:18,119
you're becoming the dark side.

753
00:44:25,578 --> 00:44:27,994
He called me and he asked me

754
00:44:28,078 --> 00:44:30,203
if I would like to be Night King.

755
00:44:30,286 --> 00:44:34,203
And I don't heard Night King,
I heard just king.

756
00:44:34,286 --> 00:44:36,244
And I said, "I can be any king."

757
00:44:36,328 --> 00:44:38,370
You know. Don't worry.

758
00:44:42,578 --> 00:44:44,286
I think he's angry.

759
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:46,119
He don't want to be Night King.

760
00:44:46,203 --> 00:44:48,536
The Children of the Forest,
they changed him,

761
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:52,036
and now he's, "Okay,
you want me to be Night King?

762
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:54,495
Okay. Now I kill you."

763
00:44:57,828 --> 00:44:59,620
My name is Aberdale Strongbeard.

764
00:44:59,703 --> 00:45:02,870
Uh, I have fought for Stannis Baratheon.

765
00:45:02,953 --> 00:45:05,411
I've also fought for, uh, Jon Snow,

766
00:45:05,495 --> 00:45:07,370
and that's where
I currently find myself,

767
00:45:07,453 --> 00:45:09,370
as part of Jon Snow's Stark army.

768
00:45:09,453 --> 00:45:11,119
I've been taking out the undead,

769
00:45:11,203 --> 00:45:12,703
you know, thinning them out

770
00:45:12,787 --> 00:45:15,620
before they actually reach Winterfell.

771
00:45:26,286 --> 00:45:28,036
I don't want to be on the Night Watch,

772
00:45:28,119 --> 00:45:30,620
I'm in House Stark, thank you very much.

773
00:45:30,703 --> 00:45:33,244
I'm not a thief, I'm not a rapist, okay?

774
00:45:33,328 --> 00:45:34,912
It's just Watch now.

775
00:45:34,994 --> 00:45:36,745
I'm not even a second son of a lord

776
00:45:36,828 --> 00:45:38,578
who wants honor up on the Wall.

777
00:45:38,662 --> 00:45:41,495
I'm a man of House Stark,
that's what I am.

778
00:45:41,578 --> 00:45:44,244
I don't want to be a Frey. No way Frey.

779
00:45:44,328 --> 00:45:47,453
I don't want to be a Lannister.
I don't want to be a Bolton.

780
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:49,828
House Stark. Absolutely has to be them.

781
00:45:49,912 --> 00:45:51,286
- Why?
- Why?

782
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:54,244
Um, the direwolfs are just cool,

783
00:45:54,328 --> 00:45:57,161
Eddard Stark,
fighting for Eddard, revenge.

784
00:45:57,244 --> 00:45:59,912
Mad about Jon Snow,
my favorite character.

785
00:45:59,994 --> 00:46:02,620
The armor's cool. Winterfell's class.

786
00:46:02,703 --> 00:46:04,953
It's just, like,
the main family in the story.

787
00:46:05,036 --> 00:46:09,411
I was standing up at
Magheramorne Quarry Season 6,

788
00:46:09,495 --> 00:46:11,328
and I had just met Gerald.

789
00:46:11,411 --> 00:46:13,036
And then we're just chatting,

790
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:15,787
and then the next thing
here comes Kit Harington

791
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:19,787
on a horse and Kit Harington's like,
"Oh, hello, Gerald."

792
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:21,244
Just like that.

793
00:46:21,328 --> 00:46:24,745
And they just start talking
like they're friends.

794
00:46:24,828 --> 00:46:27,203
And then Kit goes off on the horse,

795
00:46:27,286 --> 00:46:28,787
and I'm just like...

796
00:46:34,828 --> 00:46:37,870
- Let's move, boys.
- All right. We're out of here.

797
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:42,203
And on six, five, four, three, two, one,

798
00:46:42,286 --> 00:46:44,244
at the end you guys get back up again.

799
00:46:44,328 --> 00:46:45,994
I'm kind of doing the general...

800
00:46:46,912 --> 00:46:48,536
I can get them with no arms.

801
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:49,870
That's fair.

802
00:46:53,536 --> 00:46:55,620
Go, go, go.

803
00:46:55,703 --> 00:46:59,787
Five, four, three, two, one.

804
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:03,745
Fire! One, two, three, four...

805
00:47:03,828 --> 00:47:07,411
...five, six, seven, eight.

806
00:47:08,578 --> 00:47:10,745
I want the episode.

807
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,662
- 2019, man.
- I fucking want it.

808
00:47:13,745 --> 00:47:16,994
It'll be the longest we'll
have to wait to watch it too.

809
00:47:17,078 --> 00:47:18,495
You know what I mean?

810
00:47:18,578 --> 00:47:20,495
From being here to
watching it on-screen.

811
00:47:20,578 --> 00:47:23,411
- Are you not loving this?
- Yeah. It's kick ass.

812
00:47:23,495 --> 00:47:26,994
We're stood in the middle of Winterfell.

813
00:47:27,078 --> 00:47:29,036
Take it in. Drink it in.

814
00:47:45,453 --> 00:47:46,703
And action.

815
00:48:28,161 --> 00:48:30,078
Three, two, one.

816
00:48:31,495 --> 00:48:32,553
Action.

817
00:48:47,184 --> 00:48:50,244
The big heavy makeup is quite
hard work, the last couple days

818
00:48:50,328 --> 00:48:52,453
some of us have been
doing like 18-hour days.

819
00:48:52,536 --> 00:48:54,912
- Is he heavy?
- It is a heavy wound,

820
00:48:54,994 --> 00:48:56,745
even if it doesn't say heavy wounds.

821
00:48:56,828 --> 00:48:59,620
Yeah, so next round, all heavy wounds.

822
00:49:01,036 --> 00:49:02,787
Did we order you some gloopy blood?

823
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:04,328
Was this for you?

824
00:49:04,411 --> 00:49:06,453
Was it turned things with dark scabs?

825
00:49:06,536 --> 00:49:07,912
Well, they're nice and cold.

826
00:49:07,994 --> 00:49:09,370
See if you can take them all.

827
00:49:09,453 --> 00:49:12,620
See if we can get all of them.

828
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:14,244
Amazing.

829
00:49:17,994 --> 00:49:22,244
Just talking to somebody, Lottie.

830
00:49:22,328 --> 00:49:24,286
We've moved to a different location now,

831
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:25,745
we're somewhere else.

832
00:49:25,828 --> 00:49:28,036
You had to do the homework
that they gave you?

833
00:49:28,119 --> 00:49:30,745
- Yeah, that was the same one.
- Oh.

834
00:49:30,828 --> 00:49:33,620
Look, this is some of our Easter stuff.

835
00:49:33,703 --> 00:49:36,453
Oh, she's showing things
she shouldn't be showing.

836
00:49:38,321 --> 00:49:39,404
They were hidden.

837
00:49:39,439 --> 00:49:41,745
- They were hidden.
- For Easter.

838
00:49:41,828 --> 00:49:44,036
Lottie, you found them.

839
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:47,453
That wasn't a very good
hiding place, Nana. Was it?

840
00:49:47,536 --> 00:49:49,119
Yeah...

841
00:49:49,203 --> 00:49:51,286
Don't do that, Lottie.

842
00:49:51,370 --> 00:49:53,370
All right, then, poppet.

843
00:49:53,453 --> 00:49:56,328
I'll speak to you again tomorrow.

844
00:49:56,411 --> 00:50:00,161
All right, do some good swimming, yeah?

845
00:50:00,244 --> 00:50:01,912
We'll do some reading now.

846
00:50:01,994 --> 00:50:03,495
You're gonna go do some reading,

847
00:50:03,578 --> 00:50:06,328
and you'll practice your spellings.

848
00:50:06,411 --> 00:50:08,994
All right, then, poppet. I'm gonna go.

849
00:50:09,078 --> 00:50:10,745
I'm gonna go.

850
00:50:10,828 --> 00:50:13,912
- Bye.
- All right, then.

851
00:50:13,994 --> 00:50:16,101
Uh... Uh...

852
00:50:16,536 --> 00:50:18,161
All right, then, sweet. Love you.

853
00:50:18,244 --> 00:50:22,078
Uh... Bye.

854
00:50:23,912 --> 00:50:25,828
That's it.

855
00:50:25,912 --> 00:50:27,787
Funny little thing.

856
00:50:30,912 --> 00:50:32,536
I think it's unfortunate

857
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:34,703
that both her parents are here,

858
00:50:34,787 --> 00:50:37,286
so she hasn't even
got one of us at home.

859
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:40,244
This was never the plan, so...

860
00:50:43,036 --> 00:50:46,203
I'm just gonna go see
where that stunt person is.

861
00:50:58,071 --> 00:51:01,175
_

862
00:51:06,453 --> 00:51:08,244
Morning.

863
00:51:08,328 --> 00:51:10,703
I have to travel with them
in my hand luggage,

864
00:51:10,787 --> 00:51:12,703
like my little pets.

865
00:51:12,787 --> 00:51:15,203
Wallet, your passport, and your wig.

866
00:51:17,912 --> 00:51:20,536
Today's scene, she's a lot tidier.

867
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:22,912
'Cause she hasn't been
on the dragon yet.

868
00:51:22,994 --> 00:51:24,453
It will be a little bit more...

869
00:51:24,536 --> 00:51:26,411
I'll need to be a little bit more on it.

870
00:51:26,495 --> 00:51:29,078
When you've got a long wig,
you're busy all day

871
00:51:29,161 --> 00:51:31,119
because it all gets fuzzy,

872
00:51:31,203 --> 00:51:33,286
and I'm constantly like, "Ah, hair."

873
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:36,953
- Good morning. Hi.
- How are you doing?

874
00:51:37,036 --> 00:51:39,870
I'm just going to do my vocal
warm-up I do every morning.

875
00:51:39,953 --> 00:51:42,828
Jon Snow, Jon Snow, Jon...
J... Jon Snow.

876
00:51:44,252 --> 00:51:45,361
Jon Snow.

877
00:51:47,161 --> 00:51:48,787
I left the curtains open

878
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:50,870
when I was stark bollock the other day.

879
00:51:50,953 --> 00:51:52,328
Yesterday.

880
00:51:52,411 --> 00:51:53,787
I got out of the shower,

881
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:55,787
and a fucking drone just drove by.

882
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:03,953
I was like,
there's no privacy anymore, is there?

883
00:52:04,036 --> 00:52:05,787
That's amazing.

884
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:08,453
We came here first in our second season,

885
00:52:08,536 --> 00:52:12,119
and since then I've felt very attached

886
00:52:12,203 --> 00:52:15,578
to this place,
and it feels like Thrones.

887
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:19,119
Woodward, hello darling.

888
00:52:19,203 --> 00:52:21,328
I'm good, yes. You okay?

889
00:52:21,411 --> 00:52:24,994
When I first came onboard,
Chris sent me a picture

890
00:52:25,078 --> 00:52:26,286
of Iceland.

891
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:27,870
I saw that picture, and I said:

892
00:52:27,953 --> 00:52:30,828
"Yeah, that's what we need."

893
00:52:30,912 --> 00:52:33,745
I pitched it to HBO,

894
00:52:33,828 --> 00:52:37,411
so little was known about
how short the days were,

895
00:52:37,495 --> 00:52:41,119
how risky it was, nobody questioned it.

896
00:52:43,536 --> 00:52:45,453
It's such a magical place.

897
00:52:45,536 --> 00:52:47,328
When that sun rises,

898
00:52:47,411 --> 00:52:50,870
it's like somebody slowly
unwrapping a present.

899
00:52:50,953 --> 00:52:52,994
Morning.

900
00:52:53,078 --> 00:52:55,119
How are the bones?

901
00:52:58,578 --> 00:53:00,578
Start walking around.

902
00:53:01,578 --> 00:53:03,036
All right.

903
00:53:10,244 --> 00:53:12,203
I don't know how to ride a dragon.

904
00:53:12,286 --> 00:53:13,536
Nobody does.

905
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:15,453
Until they ride a dragon.

906
00:53:15,536 --> 00:53:17,828
No, really get in.

907
00:53:17,912 --> 00:53:19,994
Really get in for the nose.

908
00:53:20,078 --> 00:53:23,662
I could do with this amount of
snow around me all the time.

909
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:27,703
- Seriously.
- Everybody back, please.

910
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:30,536
Guys, let's clear the eye lines.
Goodbye. Thank you.

911
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:33,119
I'm the only one that's
allowed to shout around here.

912
00:53:33,203 --> 00:53:36,703
It's not looking
quite as tidy as it once did.

913
00:53:37,654 --> 00:53:39,453
I should split.

914
00:53:39,536 --> 00:53:42,994
Bloody hair's just moved again.

915
00:53:45,161 --> 00:53:47,620
Do you have an opinion
on the hand warmers?

916
00:53:47,703 --> 00:53:49,328
Cam left, pan out.

917
00:53:49,411 --> 00:53:50,728
Snow.

918
00:53:50,912 --> 00:53:52,536
Snow.

919
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:57,495
Snow. Jon Snow in snow. Ha-ha-ha.

920
00:53:57,578 --> 00:54:00,912
Ready, and, action.

921
00:54:00,994 --> 00:54:03,078
Move to your right little bit, Emilia.

922
00:54:03,161 --> 00:54:04,870
And growl.

923
00:54:04,953 --> 00:54:06,495
One more kiss, a little bit more,

924
00:54:06,578 --> 00:54:08,036
and Emilia go a bit more to your right,

925
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:11,787
kissing and moving around, and still.

926
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:13,745
Growl.

927
00:54:13,828 --> 00:54:15,411
One more, ready?

928
00:54:15,495 --> 00:54:17,036
Growl.

929
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:19,328
I think we got it.
Check the plate. Good.

930
00:54:19,411 --> 00:54:21,119
Moving on.

931
00:54:22,122 --> 00:54:23,745
In our hearts, it was important for us

932
00:54:23,828 --> 00:54:27,411
to come here. It wouldn't have
felt the same if we didn't.

933
00:54:27,495 --> 00:54:32,161
It just makes my heart really smile.

934
00:54:42,286 --> 00:54:43,953
Nine minutes to 7.

935
00:54:44,036 --> 00:54:45,620
The so-called beast from the east

936
00:54:45,703 --> 00:54:47,036
is making its presence felt

937
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:48,787
in both Britain and Ireland.

938
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:51,203
Ireland under the
highest weather warning,

939
00:54:51,286 --> 00:54:53,745
with the worst snow seen for 35 years.

940
00:54:53,828 --> 00:54:56,745
Four hundred and forty
schools will be closed today.

941
00:54:56,828 --> 00:54:59,745
People have been told to stay indoors.

942
00:54:59,828 --> 00:55:01,662
_

943
00:55:02,122 --> 00:55:03,646
_

944
00:55:03,647 --> 00:55:06,486
_

945
00:55:06,654 --> 00:55:09,394
_

946
00:55:17,411 --> 00:55:18,828
I need to get back here by 10.

947
00:55:18,912 --> 00:55:21,870
That's all because we can't
open the doors anymore.

948
00:55:21,953 --> 00:55:23,411
- What?
- We should...

949
00:55:23,495 --> 00:55:24,662
In usual circumstances,

950
00:55:24,745 --> 00:55:27,244
we would just take that straight out.

951
00:55:27,328 --> 00:55:28,536
Um...

952
00:55:28,537 --> 00:55:31,227
_

953
00:55:31,262 --> 00:55:33,994
We're so, so tight now,
in terms of time,

954
00:55:34,078 --> 00:55:38,787
that something like, you know,
this sort of poor weather

955
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:41,119
makes this a bigger deal
for us than it should.

956
00:55:41,203 --> 00:55:43,244
Is this a harder season than others?

957
00:55:43,328 --> 00:55:45,328
- By a long shot.
- By a long way.

958
00:55:45,411 --> 00:55:48,578
The schedule is impossible. And...

959
00:55:50,286 --> 00:55:51,870
The season is very big.

960
00:55:51,953 --> 00:55:54,912
It's written very big,
um, but we have...

961
00:55:54,994 --> 00:55:57,870
It's just all this
business of trying to do,

962
00:55:57,953 --> 00:56:00,078
you know,
film finishes on a TV schedule,

963
00:56:00,161 --> 00:56:02,495
and on a TV deadline. And, um...

964
00:56:02,578 --> 00:56:03,787
And I think this season,

965
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:05,328
we've certainly found the limit

966
00:56:05,411 --> 00:56:06,994
of what's able to be achieved.

967
00:56:07,078 --> 00:56:08,411
And, um...

968
00:56:08,495 --> 00:56:12,662
And insofar as I think,
now everybody, um, realizes

969
00:56:12,745 --> 00:56:14,453
that Game of Thrones has to finish

970
00:56:14,536 --> 00:56:16,536
because it just cannot get any bigger.

971
00:56:17,438 --> 00:56:19,662
You know, there are a lot of
frayed nerves walking around,

972
00:56:19,745 --> 00:56:21,703
um, myself being one of them.

973
00:56:31,453 --> 00:56:34,078
We're still totally, 100 percent

974
00:56:34,161 --> 00:56:35,994
frozen over at Tomb.

975
00:56:36,078 --> 00:56:39,953
No, I mean, yesterday we had 250 extras,

976
00:56:40,036 --> 00:56:43,078
and all the crew and not one toilet.

977
00:56:43,161 --> 00:56:46,119
In the bowls, the bleach was frozen.

978
00:56:46,203 --> 00:56:47,578
That's wild.

979
00:56:47,662 --> 00:56:49,370
Oh, it was the icicles

980
00:56:49,453 --> 00:56:51,994
hanging off the taps
that I couldn't believe.

981
00:56:52,078 --> 00:56:54,578
You try and preempt as much as you can,

982
00:56:54,662 --> 00:56:59,453
but sometimes it just
gets to a stage where,

983
00:56:59,536 --> 00:57:03,828
you know, you just can't hold
mother nature back anymore.

984
00:57:08,161 --> 00:57:10,578
I mean,
it's starting to snow again now so,

985
00:57:10,662 --> 00:57:13,036
you know, it's one of them,
"I can't really say

986
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:14,244
"that we're gonna do work

987
00:57:14,328 --> 00:57:16,286
until I know we can do some work."

988
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:19,036
Is that a good enough answer for you?

989
00:57:20,248 --> 00:57:21,536
I can't really say anything else,

990
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:23,328
'cause it's snowing. And if it snows,

991
00:57:23,411 --> 00:57:26,328
well, we can't just dress
on top of real snow.

992
00:57:26,411 --> 00:57:28,953
Cheers. Thanks a lot. Bye.

993
00:57:29,036 --> 00:57:30,094
Bye.

994
00:57:33,536 --> 00:57:37,203
It was not a good idea to have
been doing it in the winter.

995
00:57:37,286 --> 00:57:40,203
You needed to have spread
the snow locations out,

996
00:57:40,286 --> 00:57:43,495
because we can't do
that many at one time.

997
00:57:43,578 --> 00:57:45,328
Look at all this nonsense,

998
00:57:45,411 --> 00:57:47,453
it just keeps coming
through all the time.

999
00:57:47,536 --> 00:57:49,370
It's like, okay, like I've got time

1000
00:57:49,453 --> 00:57:51,703
to keep pulling my
phone out of my pocket.

1001
00:57:51,787 --> 00:57:56,244
Zigzag road, they made us put
up a horizon the night before,

1002
00:57:56,328 --> 00:57:59,370
came in in the morning ready to shoot...

1003
00:57:59,453 --> 00:58:00,703
"Can you take that down?"

1004
00:58:00,787 --> 00:58:04,411
So that's half a day of mine wasted.

1005
00:58:05,994 --> 00:58:08,411
So, what we're doing,
we're getting this snow up,

1006
00:58:08,495 --> 00:58:10,453
so we can take it up to Magheramorne,

1007
00:58:10,536 --> 00:58:14,870
the battlefield.
You know, we're just under the cost.

1008
00:58:14,953 --> 00:58:16,495
Ah, shit.

1009
00:58:16,578 --> 00:58:18,411
The wind's blowing a good one here.

1010
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:21,161
You, Dicky,
you up at Magheramorne?

1011
00:58:21,244 --> 00:58:25,953
There is no water at all.
Nightmare. All right, mate.

1012
00:58:26,036 --> 00:58:27,620
Tara, tara.

1013
00:58:28,994 --> 00:58:31,161
It's all frozen up at Magheramorne.

1014
00:58:31,244 --> 00:58:34,244
Now I have to sort out a pump
and pump it out the lake

1015
00:58:34,328 --> 00:58:38,495
and, ugh! Fucking hell.

1016
00:58:38,578 --> 00:58:39,953
How's it going, Del?

1017
00:58:40,036 --> 00:58:43,453
It is all going.
I just feel like crying.

1018
00:58:47,453 --> 00:58:49,453
This car's got no bollocks.

1019
00:58:49,536 --> 00:58:51,453
This Fiesta, stupid little thing.

1020
00:58:56,787 --> 00:58:58,703
You know, it's difficult to find people

1021
00:58:58,787 --> 00:59:00,953
who know the job,
and it's not rocket science.

1022
00:59:01,036 --> 00:59:03,912
I mean, you could do it, Jeanie.
It ain't hard.

1023
00:59:07,078 --> 00:59:09,453
Welcome to hell, George.
Welcome to hell.

1024
00:59:12,786 --> 00:59:15,709
_

1025
00:59:17,161 --> 00:59:19,994
I'm not one for listening
to people whinge.

1026
00:59:20,078 --> 00:59:21,662
I just think, "Oh, come on."

1027
00:59:21,745 --> 00:59:24,078
I was brought up in children's homes.

1028
00:59:24,161 --> 00:59:26,953
You know, I didn't have a clue
where me mom and dad was.

1029
00:59:27,036 --> 00:59:29,411
I left the homes when
I was 16-and-a-half.

1030
00:59:29,495 --> 00:59:32,578
They give you 300 quid,
your bloody birth certificate,

1031
00:59:32,662 --> 00:59:34,578
and all right, get yourself out there.

1032
00:59:35,031 --> 00:59:36,536
It's just, "Hm. Okay, then."

1033
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:38,244
So, yeah, that opened my eyes.

1034
00:59:39,788 --> 00:59:41,536
As I've progressed, you know,
I've always got more money

1035
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:43,286
and I just think, "To keep that,

1036
00:59:43,370 --> 00:59:45,828
I'll have to keep working
at the pace I'm working."

1037
00:59:45,912 --> 00:59:48,578
You just want to do
the best for your kids.

1038
00:59:48,662 --> 00:59:51,411
You know, I'd give up
my house for my kids.

1039
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:07,286
I've never not done a set yet,

1040
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:09,161
but it's been very close twice.

1041
01:00:09,244 --> 01:00:11,286
This is the second time it's been close.

1042
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:14,953
But we'll get there. I think.

1043
01:00:19,912 --> 01:00:22,411
Hi. My horses are dyed pink.

1044
01:00:22,495 --> 01:00:23,536
_

1045
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:24,994
Don't even go there.

1046
01:00:25,078 --> 01:00:28,203
They've tried warm water, Fairy liquid,

1047
01:00:28,286 --> 01:00:31,286
- I can't get them back to white.
- Look at the state of him.

1048
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:35,703
One of them might be saying,
"I'm pink. I don't like pink."

1049
01:00:39,490 --> 01:00:40,495
Magheramorne Quarry's been the site

1050
01:00:40,578 --> 01:00:42,119
of the Battle of the Blackwater,

1051
01:00:42,203 --> 01:00:44,870
Hardhome, it's also Castle Black.

1052
01:00:44,953 --> 01:00:48,036
This is the biggest green
screen I have ever seen,

1053
01:00:48,119 --> 01:00:51,286
but it's really impressive
what they've built here.

1054
01:00:55,453 --> 01:00:58,161
This battle sequence
I think we have coming up.

1055
01:00:58,244 --> 01:01:01,745
They don't tend to
tell us a lot of stuff.

1056
01:01:03,328 --> 01:01:05,078
On the day, one of the ADs get up

1057
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:07,912
and actually tells us what's
actually happening that day.

1058
01:01:09,922 --> 01:01:11,828
The numbers we've just heard

1059
01:01:11,912 --> 01:01:15,161
are 120,000 wights...

1060
01:01:15,244 --> 01:01:18,286
...against 18,000

1061
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:21,745
um, combined in Daenerys's army

1062
01:01:21,828 --> 01:01:23,953
and Jon Snow's army as well, like.

1063
01:01:24,036 --> 01:01:26,495
So we're extremely outnumbered.

1064
01:01:26,578 --> 01:01:30,953
I can't even begin to imagine
how this is gonna look on TV.

1065
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:38,370
The way I like to think of it

1066
01:01:38,453 --> 01:01:41,620
is that the extras department
is like one of the main actors.

1067
01:01:41,703 --> 01:01:44,036
Just as important.

1068
01:01:44,119 --> 01:01:46,536
I got a close-up at the
Battle of the Bastards,

1069
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:48,703
I had no idea the camera was on me.

1070
01:01:48,787 --> 01:01:55,370
Rolling.
Camera set, and three, two, one...

1071
01:01:56,703 --> 01:01:58,536
There's this collective thing

1072
01:01:58,620 --> 01:01:59,870
we know that we're all in,

1073
01:01:59,953 --> 01:02:02,370
trying to make this really exciting.

1074
01:02:02,453 --> 01:02:05,953
Because even the background
tells a big story.

1075
01:02:06,036 --> 01:02:08,662
Great stuff, thank you. We have cut.

1076
01:02:08,745 --> 01:02:11,994
March. Left, right, left.

1077
01:02:16,119 --> 01:02:18,370
- Darling.
- Cheers, thank you.

1078
01:02:21,662 --> 01:02:23,662
And a wee egg, sure.
Sophie, isn't it?

1079
01:02:23,745 --> 01:02:25,703
- Yeah, Sophie, yeah.
- Nice to meet you.

1080
01:02:25,787 --> 01:02:26,912
- Huh?
- Nice to meet you.

1081
01:02:26,994 --> 01:02:27,994
Nice to meet you too.

1082
01:02:28,078 --> 01:02:29,536
Sophie Ellis-Bextor,

1083
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:31,828
I couldn't believe it.
I'm totally starstruck.

1084
01:02:31,912 --> 01:02:33,662
One of my favorites from years ago.

1085
01:02:33,745 --> 01:02:36,828
You never get to see these
people any other time, you know?

1086
01:02:36,912 --> 01:02:38,953
But, yeah.
It's like a wee dream sometimes.

1087
01:02:39,036 --> 01:02:41,536
- They're coming to you.
- I know. I know.

1088
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:45,078
She said I was well-stocked,
and I was like...

1089
01:02:45,843 --> 01:02:47,912
Bonus.

1090
01:02:47,994 --> 01:02:50,870
Very busy and a bit stressful,

1091
01:02:50,953 --> 01:02:52,328
because of the nights.

1092
01:02:52,411 --> 01:02:53,953
How many nights have we done so far?

1093
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:57,994
- Fourteen weeks, 15 weeks?
- No, we're on our ninth.

1094
01:02:58,078 --> 01:03:00,953
- What?
- Yeah. Ninth.

1095
01:03:01,036 --> 01:03:03,453
- Yeah, it's only Week 9.
- It's only Week 9.

1096
01:03:03,536 --> 01:03:06,078
Is it really? No, it's more than that.

1097
01:03:06,161 --> 01:03:08,370
We started in January.

1098
01:03:09,033 --> 01:03:12,254
_

1099
01:03:13,552 --> 01:03:15,953
Is this the longest run
of nights on Game of Thrones?

1100
01:03:16,036 --> 01:03:18,703
Yes. In fact, we were trying to think

1101
01:03:18,787 --> 01:03:23,745
is this the longest time
any film has filmed nights?

1102
01:03:23,828 --> 01:03:26,411
I guess I could try to Google that.

1103
01:03:26,495 --> 01:03:29,453
What's the longest
nights of any film crew?

1104
01:03:29,536 --> 01:03:31,036
A smoke nightmare.

1105
01:03:32,268 --> 01:03:34,745
That's like smoke apocalypse.

1106
01:03:34,828 --> 01:03:36,453
It's almost like a bad dream.

1107
01:03:36,536 --> 01:03:41,078
I got to sleep at 9:30 in the morning,
and I slept till 1:30.

1108
01:03:41,161 --> 01:03:43,370
Three hours? Is that four hours?
I don't know.

1109
01:03:43,453 --> 01:03:45,870
One of my best-ever anxiety dreams.

1110
01:03:45,953 --> 01:03:48,203
It was a beautiful blue sky,

1111
01:03:48,286 --> 01:03:51,119
and there was a rope
strung across my vision

1112
01:03:51,203 --> 01:03:53,662
and it just got pulled taut,
taut, taut, taut.

1113
01:03:53,745 --> 01:03:55,495
Then it snapped, and I woke up.

1114
01:03:56,620 --> 01:03:57,662
_

1115
01:03:57,745 --> 01:03:59,328
I don't fucking know.

1116
01:03:59,411 --> 01:04:01,411
Sounds like anxiety to me.

1117
01:04:01,495 --> 01:04:02,953
Background and stunts,

1118
01:04:03,036 --> 01:04:04,870
until the moment we yell cut,

1119
01:04:04,953 --> 01:04:09,453
you need to hold your breath,
but also not breathe out.

1120
01:04:09,536 --> 01:04:13,244
It's gonna be amazing.
If anybody dies, let me know.

1121
01:04:16,153 --> 01:04:17,616
How are you doing? How are you feeling?

1122
01:04:17,651 --> 01:04:19,828
- Good time, yeah.
- Yeah? Were you a little sore?

1123
01:04:19,912 --> 01:04:20,828
A little sore.

1124
01:04:20,912 --> 01:04:22,662
Just the muscles ached, yeah.

1125
01:04:22,745 --> 01:04:25,244
It just gets old,
these nights. Yes, sir.

1126
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:29,994
Um, so, this... In this, you're dead.

1127
01:04:30,078 --> 01:04:31,036
Dead.

1128
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:32,578
He dies?

1129
01:04:34,367 --> 01:04:35,613
The ending makes sense.

1130
01:04:35,648 --> 01:04:37,411
- Yes.
- Everything that's gone before.

1131
01:04:37,495 --> 01:04:39,328
Certainly the way they're shooting it.

1132
01:04:39,411 --> 01:04:41,036
That he'd die for her.

1133
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:42,828
And I think that's a big part

1134
01:04:42,912 --> 01:04:44,453
- of her demise.
- Yes.

1135
01:04:45,787 --> 01:04:48,662
Ready, and action.

1136
01:05:30,453 --> 01:05:31,828
Cut.

1137
01:05:37,328 --> 01:05:39,787
Good for 8, marker.

1138
01:05:53,203 --> 01:05:56,994
I can feel the weariness setting in.

1139
01:05:57,078 --> 01:06:01,244
Tonight Candy said, "Oh,
only 14 weeks until we wrap."

1140
01:06:01,328 --> 01:06:05,411
And that made it sound like, "What? No."

1141
01:06:07,286 --> 01:06:08,578
I mean, it's a mixed thing.

1142
01:06:08,662 --> 01:06:10,536
One way, you're wishing it away,

1143
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:14,453
like, "Oh, please,
let's get through this, this and this."

1144
01:06:14,536 --> 01:06:16,662
And then the other one is like, "No,

1145
01:06:16,745 --> 01:06:18,787
I don't want this to end."

1146
01:06:33,652 --> 01:06:34,952
_

1147
01:06:34,953 --> 01:06:36,578
This is a Godswood tree.

1148
01:06:36,662 --> 01:06:39,078
Um, I think it's a magical sort of tree.

1149
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:43,078
It goes back, way back in time,
and Children of the Forest...

1150
01:06:43,161 --> 01:06:44,703
They do the Children of the Forest,

1151
01:06:44,787 --> 01:06:47,078
and they put a wee face
on the front of it there.

1152
01:06:47,161 --> 01:06:51,328
Um... Phew. But to be honest
with you I don't really know.

1153
01:06:51,411 --> 01:06:53,662
Have you done the Godswood before?

1154
01:06:53,745 --> 01:06:57,286
I do it every year.
It's my seventh year doing it.

1155
01:06:57,370 --> 01:06:59,578
Have you got a favorite character?

1156
01:06:59,662 --> 01:07:02,870
I did like Stannis before he
killed his daughter you know.

1157
01:07:02,953 --> 01:07:06,119
And I liked... At the minute...

1158
01:07:06,203 --> 01:07:09,036
I actually like the Night King,
you know.

1159
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:10,244
I'd like to have met him.

1160
01:07:10,328 --> 01:07:12,203
You know what's going to happen?

1161
01:07:12,286 --> 01:07:13,994
Yeah, I do. I do. Ha-ha-ha.

1162
01:07:14,078 --> 01:07:15,203
_

1163
01:07:15,286 --> 01:07:17,036
Yeah.

1164
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:22,036
When I read this, if it was up to me,

1165
01:07:22,119 --> 01:07:24,828
maybe it would be good
when Bran will kill me.

1166
01:07:24,912 --> 01:07:27,953
So Arya, she will appear,
I will grab her or something,

1167
01:07:28,036 --> 01:07:31,620
maybe I will kill Arya,
and Bran, he kill me.

1168
01:07:31,703 --> 01:07:34,370
- He will throw the knife to me.
- Just throw it.

1169
01:07:34,453 --> 01:07:38,536
And then this make Night King angry,
you know?

1170
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:42,703
I am happy, and then, okay,
he looking at me, and then

1171
01:07:42,787 --> 01:07:48,994
I see on his eyes and body like,
"Oh, Night King."

1172
01:07:49,078 --> 01:07:52,328
And then I... Mm... okay.

1173
01:07:53,994 --> 01:07:55,912
Arya will kill me.

1174
01:07:55,994 --> 01:07:59,662
The girl kill Night King,
how is this possible?

1175
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:04,703
This year I don't
feel so very comfortable

1176
01:08:04,787 --> 01:08:06,994
because I don't know where I belong.

1177
01:08:08,495 --> 01:08:10,578
If I'm part of the actors

1178
01:08:10,662 --> 01:08:14,828
- or I'm part of the stuntmen.
- Action.

1179
01:08:14,912 --> 01:08:17,745
Many times
the stunts are joking with me:

1180
01:08:17,828 --> 01:08:20,703
"Hey, you're the Night King,
you don't need to do nothing."

1181
01:08:20,787 --> 01:08:24,119
Sometimes I thinking,
"You know, is that true?"

1182
01:08:24,203 --> 01:08:26,578
When we finish Night King stuff,

1183
01:08:26,662 --> 01:08:28,119
I can do some fire job

1184
01:08:28,203 --> 01:08:31,745
and falling from the
stairs or some fight.

1185
01:08:31,828 --> 01:08:33,578
I looking forward.

1186
01:08:34,745 --> 01:08:37,453
Yeah, I like that. I like that.

1187
01:08:37,536 --> 01:08:40,036
So cast can step off, thank you.

1188
01:08:45,036 --> 01:08:47,953
They called you a bit early, Vlad.

1189
01:08:48,921 --> 01:08:49,536
Classic.

1190
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:52,203
- It's the movie business.
- Yeah.

1191
01:08:52,286 --> 01:08:55,578
- Waiting, waiting...
- Hurry up and wait, yep.

1192
01:08:55,662 --> 01:09:00,828
Hurry up... Do something.
And then again wait, wait.

1193
01:09:00,912 --> 01:09:03,078
- Yep.
- Kill him, kill him.

1194
01:09:03,161 --> 01:09:04,953
Kill him.

1195
01:09:11,953 --> 01:09:18,036
And camera, three, two, one, action.

1196
01:09:36,411 --> 01:09:38,953
Instead of it being a death like that,

1197
01:09:39,036 --> 01:09:43,453
it's just a...
before you even get to be surprised.

1198
01:09:44,912 --> 01:09:46,994
Got it.

1199
01:09:47,078 --> 01:09:49,745
Let's just practice dropping that knife.

1200
01:09:49,828 --> 01:09:51,953
Ready. There. Okay, that's good.

1201
01:09:52,036 --> 01:09:53,662
That really helps.

1202
01:09:53,745 --> 01:09:55,453
You should be on him all the time.

1203
01:09:55,536 --> 01:09:56,703
Yeah.

1204
01:09:56,787 --> 01:09:59,994
Miguel, he showed me the way.

1205
01:10:00,078 --> 01:10:02,370
Move from A to B.

1206
01:10:02,453 --> 01:10:05,411
It looks like easy, but...

1207
01:10:05,495 --> 01:10:08,328
it definitely is not so easy.

1208
01:10:08,411 --> 01:10:12,370
So sometimes I realize
be actor is not easy to be,

1209
01:10:12,453 --> 01:10:14,453
is better to be stuntman. Heh.

1210
01:10:14,536 --> 01:10:18,370
Three, two, one, action.

1211
01:10:18,453 --> 01:10:19,370
Stab him.

1212
01:10:19,453 --> 01:10:21,745
Good. Action.

1213
01:10:21,828 --> 01:10:23,119
Stab him.

1214
01:10:25,953 --> 01:10:28,203
Rolling reset, thank you.

1215
01:10:28,286 --> 01:10:29,994
Back to ones.

1216
01:10:33,286 --> 01:10:39,578
Ready? And three, two, one, action.

1217
01:10:39,662 --> 01:10:41,536
Drop.

1218
01:10:41,620 --> 01:10:43,244
And now turn.

1219
01:10:43,328 --> 01:10:46,703
Look up. Down. Stab him.

1220
01:10:48,119 --> 01:10:49,178
Action.

1221
01:10:49,361 --> 01:10:50,453
Action.

1222
01:10:50,536 --> 01:10:53,536
Three, two, one, action.

1223
01:10:56,495 --> 01:10:57,703
Cut.

1224
01:11:26,411 --> 01:11:28,370
We've been doing night shoots.

1225
01:11:28,453 --> 01:11:30,161
I can't remember what week this is.

1226
01:11:30,244 --> 01:11:35,036
You wake up, quickly get showered,
drive to location,

1227
01:11:35,119 --> 01:11:37,203
shoot all day, get back on the minibus,

1228
01:11:37,286 --> 01:11:40,411
quickly try and get some sleep, wake up.

1229
01:11:40,495 --> 01:11:42,119
It is like Groundhog Day.

1230
01:11:42,203 --> 01:11:44,495
If anybody ever says:

1231
01:11:44,578 --> 01:11:47,203
"How's it going, Sarah?"
I feel like saying...

1232
01:11:48,912 --> 01:11:51,578
I'm broken.

1233
01:11:51,662 --> 01:11:54,453
We feel like vampires, don't we?
I mean, seriously.

1234
01:11:54,536 --> 01:11:56,703
Everybody's just gray, aren't they?

1235
01:11:56,787 --> 01:11:59,994
Just run it through once,
so I can see it.

1236
01:12:00,078 --> 01:12:02,078
Unit call was at 8 p.m.,

1237
01:12:02,161 --> 01:12:05,244
we're supposed to wrap at 6 a.m.

1238
01:12:05,328 --> 01:12:06,703
We don't ever wrap early.

1239
01:12:06,787 --> 01:12:11,244
But there's a rumor going
around that we might wrap at 3.

1240
01:12:11,328 --> 01:12:15,328
When people start rumors
like that, it's, uh...

1241
01:12:15,411 --> 01:12:17,662
It can only get...

1242
01:12:17,745 --> 01:12:20,828
So I'm really disappointed,
if we're still here at 6.

1243
01:12:20,912 --> 01:12:23,286
When does Lottie get here,
to be an extra?

1244
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:26,912
My mother flew her over,
so that we can watch Lottie

1245
01:12:26,994 --> 01:12:28,328
being filmed for the day.

1246
01:12:28,411 --> 01:12:30,203
I haven't seen her for three weeks.

1247
01:12:30,286 --> 01:12:32,119
And there's been all this snow.

1248
01:12:32,203 --> 01:12:34,828
I've really struggled
this shoot, actually.

1249
01:12:36,633 --> 01:12:38,174
It's hard.

1250
01:12:38,209 --> 01:12:39,551
It's hard being a mum.

1251
01:12:39,586 --> 01:12:46,119
You know, I missed
her Mother's Day, um... assembly,

1252
01:12:46,203 --> 01:12:49,119
and I missed her Easter bonnet parade.

1253
01:12:50,787 --> 01:12:55,828
In the grand scheme of things,
you say it's not that long,

1254
01:12:55,912 --> 01:13:00,953
but when you're living each day,
it is a long time.

1255
01:13:01,036 --> 01:13:04,994
I need checks on Walkers, thank you.

1256
01:13:05,078 --> 01:13:07,453
...just asked we make sure we...

1257
01:13:07,536 --> 01:13:09,620
We're rolling away.

1258
01:13:09,703 --> 01:13:11,244
And action.

1259
01:13:15,119 --> 01:13:17,412
Cut. Got it, lovely.

1260
01:13:17,447 --> 01:13:18,495
That's a cut.

1261
01:13:18,530 --> 01:13:20,161
That is a wrap, good night.

1262
01:13:20,244 --> 01:13:21,355
It's a wrap!

1263
01:13:22,662 --> 01:13:24,620
It's a wrap.

1264
01:13:24,703 --> 01:13:26,286
I hope. It's a wrap.

1265
01:13:26,370 --> 01:13:28,994
Guys, thanks very much
for the last few months,

1266
01:13:29,078 --> 01:13:31,912
have an excellent Easter,
enjoy yourselves,

1267
01:13:31,994 --> 01:13:35,286
get some rest, party hard,
come back fresh.

1268
01:13:38,244 --> 01:13:40,662
Do you know what
you're going to do today?

1269
01:13:40,745 --> 01:13:44,662
I think I might go and
film at the Belfast...

1270
01:13:44,745 --> 01:13:48,244
The Belfast Game of Thrones show.

1271
01:14:06,328 --> 01:14:09,328
I love your beautiful haircut.

1272
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:19,994
- Who is it?
- The Night King.

1273
01:14:20,078 --> 01:14:21,244
And Jon Snow.

1274
01:14:25,370 --> 01:14:29,244
Lottie. That's a very exotic name.

1275
01:14:43,277 --> 01:14:44,953
She's, like, dragging it.

1276
01:14:47,806 --> 01:14:49,764
_

1277
01:15:22,954 --> 01:15:26,180
_

1278
01:15:36,073 --> 01:15:39,098
_

1279
01:15:52,370 --> 01:15:54,703
Is this Roman, then, this thing?

1280
01:15:54,787 --> 01:15:57,119
Throw him to the lions,
that sort of thing?

1281
01:15:57,203 --> 01:15:59,328
You weren't here on a previous shoot?

1282
01:15:59,411 --> 01:16:01,036
No, no. This is a first time for me.

1283
01:16:01,119 --> 01:16:04,787
Every year before, "No,
you're not going to Spain."

1284
01:16:04,870 --> 01:16:06,870
There was never anything to do.

1285
01:16:06,953 --> 01:16:08,453
_

1286
01:16:08,536 --> 01:16:10,370
It's supposed to be 'round the outside

1287
01:16:10,453 --> 01:16:12,203
where the Unsullied are, you know.

1288
01:16:13,014 --> 01:16:14,244
_

1289
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:16,045
_

1290
01:16:16,119 --> 01:16:17,578
I don't know what I'm doing here.

1291
01:16:17,662 --> 01:16:20,119
You boys could have done
it in your spare time.

1292
01:16:24,203 --> 01:16:26,828
There we are, Jeanie, that's it.

1293
01:16:26,912 --> 01:16:28,994
I don't think it's
worth doing the machine,

1294
01:16:29,078 --> 01:16:32,620
we may as well just
run it out of the bags.

1295
01:16:35,578 --> 01:16:38,411
In Season 7, Jaime was in King's Landing

1296
01:16:38,495 --> 01:16:41,036
and a snowflake landed on his hand,
didn't it?

1297
01:16:41,119 --> 01:16:45,119
So that allows you then to
put little bits wherever.

1298
01:16:45,203 --> 01:16:47,745
There isn't going to be
much snow apparently,

1299
01:16:47,828 --> 01:16:49,828
so it's just me.

1300
01:16:55,703 --> 01:17:00,036
Not too much,
just to say that it's blown in...

1301
01:17:00,119 --> 01:17:01,370
and stayed.

1302
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:08,662
Yep, that does it for me.

1303
01:17:10,536 --> 01:17:12,286
It's award-winning snow, Del.

1304
01:17:12,370 --> 01:17:14,994
- Does that mean anything?
- Yeah, it's great.

1305
01:17:15,078 --> 01:17:17,828
They brought the Emmys to
set so everybody could have

1306
01:17:17,912 --> 01:17:19,411
their photograph taken with them.

1307
01:17:19,495 --> 01:17:21,036
It's the first time I've ever had

1308
01:17:21,119 --> 01:17:22,703
my photograph taken with the Emmy.

1309
01:17:22,787 --> 01:17:25,787
Not that I'd show anything,
"This is my Emmy."

1310
01:17:25,870 --> 01:17:28,787
I've got a certificate,
we got the original...

1311
01:17:28,870 --> 01:17:30,662
We had to pay for it, but, you know,

1312
01:17:30,745 --> 01:17:33,411
I don't mind paying for it.
You know, so, yeah.

1313
01:17:33,495 --> 01:17:36,203
I was part of the Emmy award-winning...

1314
01:17:36,286 --> 01:17:38,870
So, yeah.
But you don't show that, do you?

1315
01:17:38,953 --> 01:17:41,161
It's like having a forklift license.

1316
01:17:54,244 --> 01:17:56,745
It's very hard to keep the cast quiet,

1317
01:17:56,828 --> 01:17:59,036
because when in Spain,
you must eat and drink.

1318
01:17:59,119 --> 01:18:00,745
They're going to be out and about,

1319
01:18:00,828 --> 01:18:02,662
and so we brought in a few ringers.

1320
01:18:02,745 --> 01:18:05,495
We have The Waif coming in,
because so many people think

1321
01:18:05,578 --> 01:18:08,911
that Arya is dead and
The Waif killed her.

1322
01:18:09,463 --> 01:18:11,036
We have Jaqen, who's also another

1323
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:13,787
House of Black and White character.

1324
01:18:16,870 --> 01:18:19,036
And we have the Night King here.

1325
01:18:19,119 --> 01:18:21,495
Not quite sure what he would be saying.

1326
01:18:21,578 --> 01:18:25,036
So they won't know what's happening.

1327
01:18:25,119 --> 01:18:27,078
It'll be a big surprise no matter what.

1328
01:18:32,662 --> 01:18:35,244
Jon Snow is here!

1329
01:18:37,620 --> 01:18:39,703
You are not here to speak.

1330
01:18:39,787 --> 01:18:42,578
I've had nothing to do but think

1331
01:18:42,662 --> 01:18:44,578
these past few weeks...

1332
01:18:46,286 --> 01:18:48,536
about our bloody history.

1333
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:53,411
There's nothing in the world
more powerful than a good story.

1334
01:18:53,495 --> 01:18:55,244
And who has a better story

1335
01:18:55,328 --> 01:18:58,662
than Bran the Broken?

1336
01:19:04,787 --> 01:19:08,161
It's weird,
I've come out basically as decoy.

1337
01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:12,495
It feels weird being here
and not actually filming.

1338
01:19:13,787 --> 01:19:15,620
When all the Spanish fans shout Kit,

1339
01:19:15,703 --> 01:19:18,119
they shout, "Keet! Keet!"

1340
01:19:18,203 --> 01:19:21,662
So the rest of the cast
have now dubbed me Keet.

1341
01:19:21,745 --> 01:19:22,703
Keet!

1342
01:19:22,787 --> 01:19:25,411
Keet! Keet!

1343
01:19:25,495 --> 01:19:30,745
Please, please, please, please.

1344
01:19:30,828 --> 01:19:32,036
Hi.

1345
01:19:38,328 --> 01:19:39,912
Hello.

1346
01:19:54,870 --> 01:19:57,745
Sophie. Sophie!

1347
01:20:04,787 --> 01:20:06,495
Okay.

1348
01:20:09,975 --> 01:20:12,370
I never saw this in all of my life.

1349
01:20:12,453 --> 01:20:15,620
So it's like, uh... like, uh...

1350
01:20:19,756 --> 01:20:23,244
Like a real star,
how can you live in this life, you know?

1351
01:20:23,328 --> 01:20:25,536
Everybody recognizes them, so.

1352
01:20:28,662 --> 01:20:30,411
Okay, we can come there

1353
01:20:30,495 --> 01:20:32,787
and just give them a couple sign, yeah?

1354
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:33,928
Okay, come on.

1355
01:20:36,078 --> 01:20:39,578
I would like to see if they
recognize who I am, you know?

1356
01:20:42,005 --> 01:20:44,203
Please.

1357
01:20:44,286 --> 01:20:45,662
You know who I am?

1358
01:20:45,745 --> 01:20:48,745
Yeah! Night King.

1359
01:20:48,828 --> 01:20:51,161
- Ah! Yes!
- The Night King!

1360
01:20:54,787 --> 01:20:56,787
- Where is my...?
- Winter is coming!

1361
01:20:56,870 --> 01:20:59,328
Where is my army? Yes.

1362
01:20:59,411 --> 01:21:01,662
I hope you win the war.

1363
01:21:03,370 --> 01:21:05,703
You are the best, man.

1364
01:21:05,787 --> 01:21:09,620
Hey, my friends, look at this.
Look at this. My Lord.

1365
01:21:09,703 --> 01:21:11,370
- Say something!
- What?

1366
01:21:11,453 --> 01:21:13,119
- Say hi.
- Hey!

1367
01:21:13,203 --> 01:21:14,370
Game of Thr...

1368
01:21:19,953 --> 01:21:22,078
- Winter is coming!
- Winter is coming!

1369
01:21:22,161 --> 01:21:23,787
Yes! Yes!

1370
01:22:13,203 --> 01:22:17,745
That was Vlad the
Night King's last-ever shot

1371
01:22:17,828 --> 01:22:19,953
on Game of Thrones.

1372
01:22:32,434 --> 01:22:33,464
_

1373
01:22:54,634 --> 01:22:56,243
_

1374
01:22:56,244 --> 01:22:57,662
The best moment for us

1375
01:22:57,745 --> 01:23:00,953
is actually just before
the cameras arrive.

1376
01:23:01,036 --> 01:23:03,662
When we have it to
ourselves for a minute.

1377
01:23:03,745 --> 01:23:06,244
When it's quiet,
and you can feel the set

1378
01:23:06,328 --> 01:23:08,662
has a personality of its own,

1379
01:23:08,745 --> 01:23:10,912
and it's all dressed and ready to go.

1380
01:23:10,994 --> 01:23:12,912
That's when I love it.

1381
01:23:14,036 --> 01:23:16,078
There's some mighty doors.

1382
01:23:17,745 --> 01:23:19,770
Twenty-nine weeks, four days.

1383
01:23:19,953 --> 01:23:21,620
Twenty-nine weeks, four days.

1384
01:23:22,486 --> 01:23:24,453
Not that you're counting.
Twenty-nine weeks.

1385
01:23:24,536 --> 01:23:27,411
Not bad for seven months' work.

1386
01:23:27,495 --> 01:23:30,286
You built a city in seven months.

1387
01:23:33,578 --> 01:23:36,828
I honestly can say I could
not have worked harder.

1388
01:23:36,912 --> 01:23:39,870
I really have given
this everything I have.

1389
01:23:39,953 --> 01:23:42,036
And I love it when you see people go up

1390
01:23:42,119 --> 01:23:44,370
and they do this, you know?

1391
01:23:48,953 --> 01:23:51,036
The minute that the camera arrives,

1392
01:23:51,119 --> 01:23:53,828
and the machines and lights
and hundreds of people come in,

1393
01:23:53,912 --> 01:23:55,411
they use it as they need to.

1394
01:23:57,787 --> 01:23:59,870
We're quite shy people,

1395
01:23:59,953 --> 01:24:02,328
we just want to be able
to do our work and leave.

1396
01:24:02,411 --> 01:24:04,994
I don't think the actors
would even know who I am.

1397
01:24:05,078 --> 01:24:07,495
That suits me just fine.

1398
01:24:19,787 --> 01:24:22,078
Well, I'm the carpet man.

1399
01:24:22,161 --> 01:24:25,036
Apparently, there's some looters coming.

1400
01:24:25,858 --> 01:24:28,244
My scene is to frantically
bring the carpets in

1401
01:24:28,328 --> 01:24:31,161
as quickly as I can
and close the shutters.

1402
01:24:31,244 --> 01:24:34,912
I've got the lovely
maiden across the way,

1403
01:24:34,994 --> 01:24:37,119
I'm trying to get her attention.

1404
01:24:37,203 --> 01:24:39,578
She's otherwise occupied.

1405
01:24:39,662 --> 01:24:41,994
I'm just having a little
contemplative moment,

1406
01:24:42,078 --> 01:24:43,286
enjoying the sunshine.

1407
01:24:43,370 --> 01:24:45,870
And then, yeah, all panic sets in.

1408
01:24:45,953 --> 01:24:48,787
But I'm a bit precious about my pots,

1409
01:24:48,870 --> 01:24:50,078
you might have noticed.

1410
01:24:50,161 --> 01:24:52,203
I want to get them all off the balcony.

1411
01:24:53,539 --> 01:24:55,161
Hello, can everyone hear me?

1412
01:24:55,244 --> 01:24:57,870
You have to imagine right here today

1413
01:24:57,953 --> 01:25:00,745
that this is like alarms going off.

1414
01:25:00,828 --> 01:25:02,745
There are air raid sirens.

1415
01:25:02,828 --> 01:25:05,244
You guys are trying to
get into the Red Keep,

1416
01:25:05,328 --> 01:25:06,703
which is over there.

1417
01:25:06,787 --> 01:25:10,203
Welcome to King's Landing. Let's go.

1418
01:25:10,286 --> 01:25:11,870
Action!

1419
01:25:13,495 --> 01:25:15,078
Go, go, go.

1420
01:25:43,536 --> 01:25:45,828
Good job, reset.

1421
01:25:47,994 --> 01:25:51,411
Golden Company, forward march.

1422
01:25:51,495 --> 01:25:55,119
Left, right, left, right, left.

1423
01:25:55,203 --> 01:25:56,536
Halt.

1424
01:25:58,161 --> 01:25:59,870
That's mark.

1425
01:25:59,953 --> 01:26:01,578
There's one, two, three...

1426
01:26:02,723 --> 01:26:04,870
Oh, my God, Monday is four weeks away

1427
01:26:04,953 --> 01:26:07,078
from the end of principal photography.

1428
01:26:07,161 --> 01:26:08,161
Oh, my God.

1429
01:26:08,244 --> 01:26:10,453
How are your days looking?

1430
01:26:10,536 --> 01:26:12,078
- Are they easing?
- No.

1431
01:26:12,161 --> 01:26:14,119
No, we're actually in...

1432
01:26:14,203 --> 01:26:17,703
probably almost...
I wouldn't say the toughest time,

1433
01:26:17,787 --> 01:26:20,161
but not the way we all
thought we would have our...

1434
01:26:20,244 --> 01:26:23,745
spend our golden days
at Game of Thrones.

1435
01:26:23,828 --> 01:26:25,203
What the fuck was I thinking?

1436
01:26:25,286 --> 01:26:27,994
Which is what I'm gonna
put on my tombstone.

1437
01:26:28,078 --> 01:26:29,787
Morning, morning.

1438
01:26:29,870 --> 01:26:32,536
Ladies and gentlemen, listen up please.

1439
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:34,870
Listen up. So as you all know,

1440
01:26:34,953 --> 01:26:38,286
Sam and his team have
been rigging an explosion,

1441
01:26:38,370 --> 01:26:43,703
and when we have shade,
we will blow this.

1442
01:26:43,787 --> 01:26:46,328
- So we can stay here, right?
- _

1443
01:26:46,626 --> 01:26:49,532
- _
- _

1444
01:26:49,533 --> 01:26:52,765
_

1445
01:26:52,989 --> 01:26:54,174
_

1446
01:26:54,175 --> 01:26:56,667
_

1447
01:26:57,328 --> 01:27:00,203
Can you look after Building 1, yeah?

1448
01:27:00,286 --> 01:27:03,703
You know Building 1,
outside the front? Yeah?

1449
01:27:03,787 --> 01:27:06,411
That's it then, guys.
Let's get to our stations.

1450
01:27:06,495 --> 01:27:08,787
Here we go.

1451
01:27:15,912 --> 01:27:18,328
Holy shit.

1452
01:27:22,517 --> 01:27:23,536
We haven't had a
chance to look at it yet,

1453
01:27:23,620 --> 01:27:25,703
so we've only seen the
building site so far.

1454
01:27:25,787 --> 01:27:27,870
It's the only place you
can't wait to get over

1455
01:27:27,953 --> 01:27:29,620
to watch all the men get burnt.

1456
01:27:32,161 --> 01:27:33,787
There you go, cheers. Thank you.

1457
01:27:33,870 --> 01:27:35,078
Okay, what can I get you?

1458
01:27:36,386 --> 01:27:38,328
We've only got the wee ice lollies,

1459
01:27:38,411 --> 01:27:39,828
on the board you'll see.

1460
01:27:39,829 --> 01:27:42,129
_

1461
01:27:42,161 --> 01:27:44,662
You can't beat a Pear Picking Porky.

1462
01:27:45,796 --> 01:27:48,411
Completely cleaned out of
the ice pops twice today.

1463
01:27:48,495 --> 01:27:50,745
I never thought I was
gonna see this much heat,

1464
01:27:50,828 --> 01:27:53,244
- feel this much heat.
- Complain about it so much.

1465
01:27:53,328 --> 01:27:55,161
And complain about it so much, yeah.

1466
01:27:55,244 --> 01:27:58,620
We like the cold.
We prefer the cold than the heat.

1467
01:27:58,703 --> 01:28:00,203
Thank you so much.

1468
01:28:05,578 --> 01:28:07,453
Free wave.

1469
01:28:07,536 --> 01:28:09,536
That's brilliant,
you can turn them 'round

1470
01:28:09,620 --> 01:28:11,787
and somebody's up there
spinning it manically.

1471
01:28:11,870 --> 01:28:15,994
There's going to be
projectile vomit everywhere.

1472
01:28:16,078 --> 01:28:18,119
I mean, you couldn't write it,
could you?

1473
01:28:18,203 --> 01:28:20,912
Let's put a big, massive Ferris wheel,

1474
01:28:20,994 --> 01:28:22,703
and actually not tell anybody

1475
01:28:22,787 --> 01:28:24,953
that we're putting a Ferris wheel there,

1476
01:28:25,036 --> 01:28:28,119
you know, amongst all the discussions

1477
01:28:28,203 --> 01:28:31,662
about the big weekend and our
set over there and filming.

1478
01:28:31,745 --> 01:28:34,703
Oh, no, they built
the fucking London Eye.

1479
01:28:56,119 --> 01:28:57,286
Cut there.

1480
01:28:57,370 --> 01:28:59,578
- Reset.
- Reset, please.

1481
01:28:59,662 --> 01:29:00,912
Reset.

1482
01:29:02,578 --> 01:29:04,161
Oh, yeah.

1483
01:29:04,244 --> 01:29:06,645
Do you know what club sandwich means?

1484
01:29:06,828 --> 01:29:09,244
Do you know what club sandwich means?

1485
01:29:09,328 --> 01:29:12,662
Chicken and lettuce under bacon,
that's what that is.

1486
01:29:12,745 --> 01:29:14,662
- I didn't know that.
- It's an acronym?

1487
01:29:14,745 --> 01:29:16,453
Yeah, chicken and lettuce under bacon.

1488
01:29:16,536 --> 01:29:19,328
- Learn something new every day.
- Boom. Every day's a school day.

1489
01:29:19,411 --> 01:29:20,662
Rolling!

1490
01:29:20,745 --> 01:29:23,912
We're rolling. Quiet, everyone.

1491
01:29:47,780 --> 01:29:49,328
Have we got a fake head hanging around?

1492
01:29:49,411 --> 01:29:51,828
Yep. Any severed head will do.

1493
01:29:54,953 --> 01:29:59,328
Chow, why in the fuck are you
wearing that Bolton jacket here?

1494
01:29:59,411 --> 01:30:01,286
Let me see this?

1495
01:30:02,370 --> 01:30:04,495
That's shite. Get out of here.

1496
01:30:05,668 --> 01:30:07,078
How are you, man? You all right?

1497
01:30:07,161 --> 01:30:08,912
I'm shaking your hand.

1498
01:30:11,161 --> 01:30:13,578
Fucking Boltons, man.

1499
01:30:13,662 --> 01:30:15,203
Aye, you didn't think.

1500
01:30:15,286 --> 01:30:18,828
You didn't fucking think about
wearing that jacket, did you?

1501
01:30:24,828 --> 01:30:27,495
_

1502
01:30:36,495 --> 01:30:38,495
We're rolling.

1503
01:30:38,578 --> 01:30:41,370
As soon as they shout rolling,
I'm preparing.

1504
01:30:41,453 --> 01:30:45,036
And action, I'm in Westeros.

1505
01:30:45,119 --> 01:30:47,078
Action!

1506
01:30:51,745 --> 01:30:54,620
You know,
you can only push a man so far, I think.

1507
01:30:54,703 --> 01:30:57,161
You can only push his House so far.

1508
01:30:57,244 --> 01:30:59,328
It doesn't matter how good he is,
you know?

1509
01:30:59,411 --> 01:31:02,036
If their blood gets up. It's war.

1510
01:31:03,703 --> 01:31:06,787
This is vengeance for the Red Wedding,

1511
01:31:06,870 --> 01:31:08,620
for the Starks, for seven seasons

1512
01:31:08,703 --> 01:31:11,536
of taking shit from House Lannister.

1513
01:31:11,620 --> 01:31:14,119
So we're landing down in force,

1514
01:31:14,203 --> 01:31:17,411
and we're just gonna kill
everybody inside the city.

1515
01:31:17,495 --> 01:31:20,495
Unfortunately. For them.

1516
01:31:54,411 --> 01:31:56,578
For the funeral scene, it's all about

1517
01:31:56,662 --> 01:31:58,994
blocking where everybody stands.

1518
01:31:59,078 --> 01:32:00,578
I work hard about preparation,

1519
01:32:00,662 --> 01:32:02,703
because I don't like
to waste people's time.

1520
01:32:02,787 --> 01:32:05,161
And I want to spend more
time directing actors.

1521
01:32:05,244 --> 01:32:08,203
Are you this prepared
in all areas of your life?

1522
01:32:08,286 --> 01:32:09,662
No.

1523
01:32:09,745 --> 01:32:11,286
No, I'm not.

1524
01:32:11,370 --> 01:32:13,411
If you saw my apartment this morning,

1525
01:32:13,495 --> 01:32:14,828
you'd see that, uh,

1526
01:32:14,912 --> 01:32:17,662
that didn't get any preparation at all.

1527
01:32:17,745 --> 01:32:20,370
I have to have two cleaning
ladies come twice a week.

1528
01:32:20,453 --> 01:32:24,328
It's, ah... It's so awful.
It's such a mess.

1529
01:32:26,078 --> 01:32:31,912
I want the journey to be just
as positive as the end product.

1530
01:32:31,994 --> 01:32:33,411
That's important.

1531
01:32:33,495 --> 01:32:35,953
Because what you
remember is the journey.

1532
01:32:39,332 --> 01:32:40,909
_

1533
01:32:43,620 --> 01:32:46,286
All the pyres and get people
in the foreground for us.

1534
01:32:46,370 --> 01:32:50,161
We'll basically do the eulogy,
the speech,

1535
01:32:50,244 --> 01:32:52,328
then all coming up to light the pyres,

1536
01:32:52,411 --> 01:32:53,495
they look at each other,

1537
01:32:53,578 --> 01:32:55,203
then drop down, light the pyre, cut.

1538
01:32:55,286 --> 01:32:57,328
We're going to match
the last frame of this

1539
01:32:57,411 --> 01:32:59,411
to the first frame of that.
Fill the frame

1540
01:32:59,495 --> 01:33:01,578
and send it to me and
David before you go.

1541
01:33:01,662 --> 01:33:03,662
Yeah, good. Good morning, brother.

1542
01:33:04,870 --> 01:33:06,536
- How are you?
- Good, brother.

1543
01:33:06,620 --> 01:33:09,286
- So you're just, you're dead.
- I'm dead. I'm dead.

1544
01:33:10,953 --> 01:33:13,286
Everyone wants a pied piper.

1545
01:33:13,370 --> 01:33:15,078
Not to say that I'm the pied piper,

1546
01:33:15,161 --> 01:33:17,578
but I definitely can fake it.

1547
01:33:17,662 --> 01:33:20,453
You create your own
world behind the camera.

1548
01:33:20,536 --> 01:33:22,453
You'll take the pin out,

1549
01:33:22,536 --> 01:33:25,411
and you're reaching down here.
As you put it into his chest,

1550
01:33:25,495 --> 01:33:29,411
you look at his eyes, like,
"You're a Stark now," right?

1551
01:33:29,495 --> 01:33:32,119
- Yeah.
- Then you stand up.

1552
01:33:33,142 --> 01:33:34,161
Okay.

1553
01:33:34,244 --> 01:33:35,994
- And then you go.
- Okay, cool.

1554
01:33:36,078 --> 01:33:38,620
So just give me like a couple
minutes to get into it.

1555
01:33:38,703 --> 01:33:41,453
- The way we just did it?
- Could we get

1556
01:33:41,536 --> 01:33:43,662
everybody on their
marks for the reference.

1557
01:33:43,745 --> 01:33:45,078
Let's see here.

1558
01:33:46,245 --> 01:33:48,119
Here you go, my brother. You're here.

1559
01:33:48,203 --> 01:33:50,662
A bunch of wildlings behind you.

1560
01:33:50,745 --> 01:33:52,495
If you guys can all meet him there...

1561
01:33:52,578 --> 01:33:54,994
I get pretty tired,
but I get invigorated too.

1562
01:33:55,078 --> 01:33:57,745
I guess sometimes it's a bit
of performance anxiety,

1563
01:33:57,828 --> 01:33:59,453
where I want to do a good job

1564
01:33:59,536 --> 01:34:02,370
so that everyone feels that,
"He knows what he's doing."

1565
01:34:02,453 --> 01:34:05,703
This is a dream job for a director.

1566
01:34:05,787 --> 01:34:08,536
After directing Seasons 2, 3, and 5,

1567
01:34:08,620 --> 01:34:11,662
I had to step away for a couple
seasons due to back issues.

1568
01:34:11,745 --> 01:34:13,828
And I had a couple surgeries.

1569
01:34:13,912 --> 01:34:15,828
So I missed it beyond belief.

1570
01:34:15,912 --> 01:34:21,745
And coming back now,
I appreciate it so much that...

1571
01:34:22,994 --> 01:34:24,912
This show saved my life.

1572
01:34:27,578 --> 01:34:29,828
We're now going to talk
about why we're here.

1573
01:34:29,912 --> 01:34:33,161
Everyone here,
you've all lost mothers, brothers,

1574
01:34:33,244 --> 01:34:35,703
and friends, and sisters,
and wives, and everything.

1575
01:34:35,787 --> 01:34:38,328
So background,
it's all about playing that attitude

1576
01:34:38,411 --> 01:34:41,578
all the way through.
Okay, ready? Here we go.

1577
01:34:42,761 --> 01:34:43,828
My father died in a car accident

1578
01:34:43,912 --> 01:34:45,453
when I was a year-and-a-half old,

1579
01:34:45,536 --> 01:34:47,161
so my mother and I grew up together.

1580
01:34:47,244 --> 01:34:50,161
She would listen to music,
and I'd sing and perform

1581
01:34:50,244 --> 01:34:53,370
for her friends that would
come over for dinner.

1582
01:34:53,453 --> 01:34:56,662
I wanted to be the next Barry Manilow.

1583
01:34:56,745 --> 01:35:00,078
In college, I realized that
wasn't gonna happen for me,

1584
01:35:00,161 --> 01:35:02,119
so I said to myself,
"What else can I do?"

1585
01:35:02,203 --> 01:35:06,994
And realized that my desire
to move people emotionally,

1586
01:35:07,078 --> 01:35:09,912
I could do it by being
involved in filmmaking.

1587
01:35:11,119 --> 01:35:12,286
Action.

1588
01:36:33,578 --> 01:36:34,662
Now!

1589
01:36:36,495 --> 01:36:38,620
Mr. David Nutter.

1590
01:36:45,112 --> 01:36:47,161
The atmosphere today
when we done the big group photo,

1591
01:36:47,244 --> 01:36:48,411
that hit home.

1592
01:36:49,565 --> 01:36:51,161
I said goodbye to the Night's Watch.

1593
01:36:51,244 --> 01:36:52,870
I've known them for years.

1594
01:36:55,370 --> 01:36:57,578
We all have extras jackets,

1595
01:36:57,662 --> 01:37:00,912
and I managed to give
Kit Harington one today.

1596
01:37:00,994 --> 01:37:03,578
He's now trying to give me money for it,

1597
01:37:03,662 --> 01:37:04,994
but I won't take the money,

1598
01:37:05,078 --> 01:37:07,453
because I just want to give

1599
01:37:07,536 --> 01:37:09,994
Jon Snow his jacket, big time.

1600
01:37:10,078 --> 01:37:11,912
So he'll never give me that money.

1601
01:37:11,994 --> 01:37:13,244
I don't want that money.

1602
01:37:15,370 --> 01:37:17,662
It's going to be very
emotional for the actors.

1603
01:37:17,745 --> 01:37:19,286
I couldn't imagine what it's like

1604
01:37:19,370 --> 01:37:22,411
for them to finally say goodbye.

1605
01:37:38,328 --> 01:37:41,119
We're in no rush this morning.

1606
01:37:41,203 --> 01:37:43,828
No, I know. You know what?

1607
01:37:43,912 --> 01:37:47,244
It's Emilia's last day,
we're in no rush.

1608
01:37:50,662 --> 01:37:53,620
Is there any part of you
that's a bit relieved?

1609
01:37:53,703 --> 01:37:56,328
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

1610
01:37:56,411 --> 01:37:58,161
- Uh, yeah.
- Like, not in a:

1611
01:37:58,244 --> 01:38:02,161
"Oh, thank fuck that's over,"
but as in...

1612
01:38:02,244 --> 01:38:06,203
like a, "Oh, right, that's one thing

1613
01:38:06,286 --> 01:38:08,870
I don't need to panic about anymore."

1614
01:38:08,953 --> 01:38:10,536
I'm tired.

1615
01:38:10,620 --> 01:38:12,244
Tired.

1616
01:38:12,328 --> 01:38:15,036
I kind of had enough just now.

1617
01:38:15,119 --> 01:38:16,215
Mm.

1618
01:38:16,662 --> 01:38:19,536
- It's that bittersweet...
- Yeah, exactly.

1619
01:38:19,620 --> 01:38:21,411
Because my life's been on pause,

1620
01:38:21,495 --> 01:38:24,078
let's unpause it and get
that garden fence painted.

1621
01:38:24,161 --> 01:38:26,411
Exactly. Yeah, for heaven's sake.

1622
01:38:26,495 --> 01:38:29,453
Put that picture on the wall, damn it.

1623
01:38:30,994 --> 01:38:34,453
But yeah,
there's definitely an exhale of breath.

1624
01:38:34,536 --> 01:38:36,536
So many people involved in this.

1625
01:38:36,620 --> 01:38:40,036
You know, it's just people's everything.

1626
01:38:41,453 --> 01:38:43,870
It's kind of exciting to sort of think:

1627
01:38:43,953 --> 01:38:47,495
"Oh, who am I without this, then?"

1628
01:38:48,161 --> 01:38:49,286
I wonder.

1629
01:38:55,994 --> 01:38:57,119
Adjust.

1630
01:38:58,787 --> 01:39:01,578
I'm trying to remember
the first time we put this on.

1631
01:39:01,662 --> 01:39:04,578
I saw a clip of that the other day,

1632
01:39:04,662 --> 01:39:07,244
when you were riding on
that horse through Belfast,

1633
01:39:07,328 --> 01:39:09,161
and it was absolutely freezing.

1634
01:39:09,244 --> 01:39:11,787
And you were in, like,
nothing but a slip.

1635
01:39:11,870 --> 01:39:13,161
Yeah.

1636
01:39:13,244 --> 01:39:15,620
No such thing as thermals back then.

1637
01:39:24,370 --> 01:39:28,620
I'm not sure this wig's got
much more life left in it.

1638
01:39:28,703 --> 01:39:33,119
Neither has the head
underneath it, so...

1639
01:39:33,203 --> 01:39:35,411
Oh, it's the last time.

1640
01:39:35,495 --> 01:39:37,370
It's the last time.

1641
01:39:39,161 --> 01:39:40,912
Oh, that's really weird.

1642
01:40:42,119 --> 01:40:45,703
That was Emilia's
last shot on Game of Thrones.

1643
01:40:52,244 --> 01:40:54,953
This is my idea of hell,
at the moment.

1644
01:40:55,036 --> 01:40:57,745
I hate goodbyes anyway,
I'm not good at it.

1645
01:40:57,828 --> 01:41:00,036
I'll try to just sneak out the back door

1646
01:41:00,119 --> 01:41:01,828
and miss this bit out.

1647
01:41:20,828 --> 01:41:23,495
Here's a bit of wood I could take home.

1648
01:41:27,912 --> 01:41:30,620
That's where we stabbed Jon Snow.

1649
01:41:30,703 --> 01:41:32,953
I'll never forget that one.

1650
01:41:36,286 --> 01:41:39,203
Well, old girl, cheerio.

1651
01:41:39,286 --> 01:41:41,912
Served us well.

1652
01:41:41,994 --> 01:41:44,411
Sleep tight.

1653
01:41:57,203 --> 01:42:00,703
Okay. Now I've got everything packed.

1654
01:42:30,724 --> 01:42:32,745
It's just fucking tele, isn't it?

1655
01:42:32,828 --> 01:42:38,453
Oh... So this has been
really quite hard.

1656
01:42:39,857 --> 01:42:41,994
And, um, I think,

1657
01:42:42,078 --> 01:42:45,119
you know, some days we've really
struggled to get through it.

1658
01:42:45,203 --> 01:42:47,662
I think if it wasn't for
you guys and your morale,

1659
01:42:47,745 --> 01:42:49,787
that's really what has got us through.

1660
01:42:49,870 --> 01:42:51,370
But this is obviously a big end.

1661
01:42:51,453 --> 01:42:52,994
I know lots of you are going home

1662
01:42:53,078 --> 01:42:54,912
as of the weekend, and I hope

1663
01:42:54,994 --> 01:42:57,994
that we get other
projects like this again.

1664
01:42:58,078 --> 01:42:59,094
I don't.

1665
01:43:00,870 --> 01:43:02,912
Because I want to keep
the team together.

1666
01:43:02,994 --> 01:43:05,328
So thank you, everybody. Thank you.

1667
01:43:13,703 --> 01:43:16,662
So it's me, you, Big Johnny.

1668
01:43:16,745 --> 01:43:18,495
Shane Cavanaugh's coming in too.

1669
01:43:18,578 --> 01:43:19,703
All right.

1670
01:43:19,787 --> 01:43:21,620
I heard it's only 12 people doing it.

1671
01:43:21,703 --> 01:43:24,078
Yeah, there's only 10 Unsullied.

1672
01:43:25,119 --> 01:43:26,870
You all right, man?

1673
01:43:26,953 --> 01:43:29,286
There's very few of us in for this.

1674
01:43:29,370 --> 01:43:31,203
I was just told I have a feature

1675
01:43:31,286 --> 01:43:32,994
there at the very last episode.

1676
01:43:33,078 --> 01:43:35,495
So Jon's honor guard,
I was like, no way.

1677
01:43:35,578 --> 01:43:36,745
- So...
- Do you think

1678
01:43:36,828 --> 01:43:38,328
you'll get seen on camera?

1679
01:43:38,411 --> 01:43:42,912
Eh, because it's such a tight scene

1680
01:43:42,994 --> 01:43:46,119
with less numbers, possibly, yeah.

1681
01:43:46,203 --> 01:43:48,536
Yeah. So, um...

1682
01:43:48,620 --> 01:43:52,244
It'll be like, yeah, just point to me,

1683
01:43:52,328 --> 01:43:53,994
"Dad, there I am. Look again."

1684
01:43:54,078 --> 01:43:56,411
And he'll be like, "Yep. Again."

1685
01:43:57,495 --> 01:43:58,994
So it would be a brilliant way

1686
01:43:59,078 --> 01:44:01,078
to cap off the season.

1687
01:44:01,161 --> 01:44:06,828
2016, 2015.

1688
01:44:07,889 --> 01:44:11,703
I'm trying to find Andy
McClay's first day.

1689
01:44:12,854 --> 01:44:14,453
Ah, there he is.

1690
01:44:14,536 --> 01:44:16,578
This is the first makeup look.

1691
01:44:16,662 --> 01:44:19,536
I was like, you'll never get
a part if you look like that.

1692
01:44:19,620 --> 01:44:21,787
You'll have to change your expression.

1693
01:44:21,870 --> 01:44:24,411
And then we got Andy McClay.

1694
01:44:24,495 --> 01:44:26,328
Cold Andy.

1695
01:44:27,411 --> 01:44:28,912
It's as if it's Day 1.

1696
01:44:28,994 --> 01:44:33,703
You came in and you told me that
your house had just burnt down.

1697
01:44:33,787 --> 01:44:35,244
Oh, yeah, the fire in the house.

1698
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:37,620
I was like,
and you're here for a makeup test?

1699
01:44:37,703 --> 01:44:38,870
Had a fire in the house.

1700
01:44:38,953 --> 01:44:40,119
You weren't late either.

1701
01:44:40,203 --> 01:44:42,578
No, I wasn't late.
This is the thing, man.

1702
01:44:42,662 --> 01:44:44,912
Escape from the reality.

1703
01:44:48,119 --> 01:44:49,787
- Right.
- Look there, now.

1704
01:44:49,870 --> 01:44:50,662
Argh.

1705
01:44:50,745 --> 01:44:51,953
- And shoot.
- Sorted.

1706
01:44:52,036 --> 01:44:53,953
Off you pop, off you pop.

1707
01:44:54,036 --> 01:44:55,828
Goodbye, Andy.

1708
01:44:57,453 --> 01:45:00,828
This is sinking in now,
that it's my last day.

1709
01:45:03,578 --> 01:45:07,370
Just back to normal life now,
after this.

1710
01:45:12,536 --> 01:45:14,870
Good morning, how are you?
Nice to see you.

1711
01:45:19,495 --> 01:45:20,703
Kit, all right, man.

1712
01:45:20,787 --> 01:45:22,244
_

1713
01:45:22,328 --> 01:45:25,036
Ah, nice one, man. Nice one, man.

1714
01:45:25,953 --> 01:45:28,328
Do you want a Season 8 one?

1715
01:45:28,411 --> 01:45:30,828
A Targaryen dragon man
with a direwolf head

1716
01:45:30,912 --> 01:45:34,328
in the middle of it,
that's what we're getting for Season 8.

1717
01:45:34,411 --> 01:45:36,703
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- _

1718
01:45:36,787 --> 01:45:39,244
Yeah? I can get you one
of them if you want one.

1719
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:42,244
Yeah, man. Yeah. Some detail.

1720
01:45:42,245 --> 01:45:43,932
_

1721
01:45:43,933 --> 01:45:45,533
_

1722
01:45:45,578 --> 01:45:46,703
- Yeah, yeah.
- _

1723
01:45:47,578 --> 01:45:48,994
Sweet, man.

1724
01:45:49,078 --> 01:45:51,203
- Nice, man.
- See ya.

1725
01:45:51,286 --> 01:45:52,411
Sweet, eh?

1726
01:45:52,412 --> 01:45:53,412
_

1727
01:45:53,536 --> 01:45:55,703
- I know, man. I know.
- Last day.

1728
01:45:55,787 --> 01:45:58,203
Aw, what?

1729
01:46:02,703 --> 01:46:07,370
In the name of the one true queen,
Daenerys Targaryen,

1730
01:46:07,453 --> 01:46:09,244
I sentence you to die.

1731
01:46:09,328 --> 01:46:11,036
Grey Worm.

1732
01:46:11,119 --> 01:46:12,828
Grey Worm, he's totally gone,

1733
01:46:12,912 --> 01:46:14,870
and of course Jon's
trying to save lives,

1734
01:46:14,953 --> 01:46:17,703
so him and Grey Worm
have a standoff there.

1735
01:46:17,787 --> 01:46:19,745
I think that the Starks
in the background

1736
01:46:19,828 --> 01:46:21,536
are in a very precarious situation,

1737
01:46:21,620 --> 01:46:23,745
because we hate Lannisters.

1738
01:46:25,870 --> 01:46:27,703
We don't care if they die.

1739
01:46:27,787 --> 01:46:30,828
But it's our king's command.
If the Unsullied are

1740
01:46:30,912 --> 01:46:33,745
pointing their spears at him
we're not happy with that.

1741
01:46:33,828 --> 01:46:34,953
Easy.

1742
01:46:35,036 --> 01:46:38,411
Set. Three, two, one, Action.

1743
01:46:58,495 --> 01:46:59,411
Cut.

1744
01:46:59,495 --> 01:47:00,828
Okay, cut there.

1745
01:47:02,370 --> 01:47:05,119
So with that,
that is a Game of Thrones wrap

1746
01:47:05,203 --> 01:47:07,161
on our good friend Jacob Anderson,

1747
01:47:07,244 --> 01:47:10,912
Liam Cunningham, and Kit Harington.

1748
01:47:10,994 --> 01:47:14,662
Keet! Keet!

1749
01:47:14,745 --> 01:47:19,370
Ten years ago you walked in
to Nina Gold's office,

1750
01:47:19,453 --> 01:47:21,078
as a 12-year-old...

1751
01:47:23,411 --> 01:47:26,078
And here we are now.

1752
01:47:26,161 --> 01:47:27,828
Your watch has ended.

1753
01:47:27,912 --> 01:47:31,994
And it has been a hell of a watch.

1754
01:47:32,078 --> 01:47:33,828
For us, for these people,

1755
01:47:33,912 --> 01:47:36,787
and for so many people around the world.

1756
01:47:36,870 --> 01:47:38,536
Thank you for being Jon Snow,

1757
01:47:38,620 --> 01:47:41,078
and thank you more than
that for being you.

1758
01:47:45,703 --> 01:47:48,161
I feel like my heart is breaking.

1759
01:47:48,877 --> 01:47:50,453
I love this show.

1760
01:47:53,411 --> 01:47:56,161
More than, I think, anything.

1761
01:47:56,244 --> 01:47:58,870
It has never been a job for me.

1762
01:47:58,953 --> 01:48:01,328
It's been my life,
and this will always be

1763
01:48:01,411 --> 01:48:04,662
the greatest thing I'll ever
do and be a part of,

1764
01:48:04,745 --> 01:48:08,161
and you have been just my family.

1765
01:48:08,244 --> 01:48:10,662
I love you for it,
and thank you so much.

1766
01:48:21,161 --> 01:48:22,745
Reset, please.

1767
01:48:24,453 --> 01:48:26,411
_

1768
01:48:26,412 --> 01:48:28,226
_

1769
01:48:28,452 --> 01:48:30,890
_

1770
01:48:34,593 --> 01:48:36,286
Thanks, man.

1771
01:48:42,244 --> 01:48:44,161
I'm choking up here, man.

1772
01:48:44,244 --> 01:48:47,078
Honestly. Um...

1773
01:48:47,161 --> 01:48:51,286
It's what Kit was saying. Um...

1774
01:48:51,370 --> 01:48:56,411
Even though I'm just an extra...

1775
01:48:58,119 --> 01:49:01,870
in comparison to him
being the main star,

1776
01:49:01,953 --> 01:49:04,328
um, it has...

1777
01:49:04,411 --> 01:49:06,244
It really has changed my life.

1778
01:49:07,343 --> 01:49:10,536
The show... I didn't think I was going
to get this emotional.

1779
01:49:10,620 --> 01:49:12,703
It has, it really has.

1780
01:49:12,787 --> 01:49:16,495
The past five years has
been the best five years...

1781
01:49:16,578 --> 01:49:19,161
It's been the best
five years of my life.

1782
01:49:19,244 --> 01:49:21,078
So, um, I will miss it.

1783
01:49:21,161 --> 01:49:24,203
But it's always something that
I'll be able to look back on.

1784
01:49:26,573 --> 01:49:29,370
So absolutely brilliant.
It's just... It's hard to fathom

1785
01:49:29,453 --> 01:49:31,953
that I'll never be coming
back to Game of Thrones.

1786
01:49:32,036 --> 01:49:34,994
All background back to TEC.
Going this way.

1787
01:49:35,078 --> 01:49:37,244
Best thing I've ever done.

1788
01:49:51,703 --> 01:49:54,912
It's hard saying goodbye to everybody.

1789
01:49:54,994 --> 01:49:59,578
There's too many people that
you just want to talk to

1790
01:49:59,662 --> 01:50:01,953
and say how much you
love them and thank them,

1791
01:50:02,036 --> 01:50:03,912
and you just can't.

1792
01:50:03,994 --> 01:50:06,495
I think that I was able to,

1793
01:50:06,578 --> 01:50:13,495
I don't know, to bring my philosophy of,

1794
01:50:13,578 --> 01:50:19,036
you know, love and camaraderie
and family to the show.

1795
01:50:19,119 --> 01:50:23,328
You know, that's the way
I just always treat everybody.

1796
01:50:23,411 --> 01:50:26,953
If people have Game
of Thrones on their credits,

1797
01:50:27,036 --> 01:50:29,953
people know that person
had to work really hard,

1798
01:50:30,036 --> 01:50:31,787
that person knew what they were doing,

1799
01:50:31,870 --> 01:50:36,495
that person created,
you know, a magical world.

1800
01:51:24,953 --> 01:51:26,620
Ladies and gentlemen,

1801
01:51:26,703 --> 01:51:29,244
welcome to Game of Thrones tours.

1802
01:51:29,328 --> 01:51:31,994
What is dead may never die,

1803
01:51:32,078 --> 01:51:37,286
but rises again, harder and stronger.

1804
01:51:37,370 --> 01:51:40,036
So guys, you're very welcome
to Game of Thrones tours.

1805
01:51:40,119 --> 01:51:41,787
I'm gonna talk to you about this.

1806
01:51:41,870 --> 01:51:43,578
This is Carrick Castle.

1807
01:51:43,662 --> 01:51:46,620
Guys, Carrick Castle
is not in Game of Thrones,

1808
01:51:46,703 --> 01:51:49,662
so we're just going to fucking
drive on past Carrick Castle.

1809
01:51:49,745 --> 01:51:52,244
I'm going to take you to Stannis's camp,

1810
01:51:52,328 --> 01:51:53,578
what we're going to see

1811
01:51:53,662 --> 01:51:55,870
is all the lads laying
low for their gruel,

1812
01:51:55,953 --> 01:51:58,036
then who's going to pop on?

1813
01:51:58,119 --> 01:51:59,370
It's Ser Davos Seaworth,

1814
01:51:59,453 --> 01:52:01,578
Hand of the King to Stannis Baratheon.

1815
01:52:01,662 --> 01:52:03,536
Easing himself onto camera,

1816
01:52:03,620 --> 01:52:04,703
that's me right there.

1817
01:52:06,286 --> 01:52:08,578
Wasn't even cold that day on set.

1818
01:52:08,662 --> 01:52:11,036
Acting, is what we call this.

1819
01:52:11,119 --> 01:52:13,203
Yeah? All right.

1820
01:52:13,286 --> 01:52:15,411
Here we come,
we're coming around the corner

1821
01:52:15,495 --> 01:52:19,161
and we're gonna see Irish mists.

1822
01:52:19,244 --> 01:52:21,161
And we're coming up here now,

1823
01:52:21,244 --> 01:52:23,286
just around this bend.

1824
01:52:23,370 --> 01:52:25,703
Castle Black, ladies and gentlemen.

1825
01:52:25,787 --> 01:52:27,745
I guarantee that it's up there.

1826
01:52:27,828 --> 01:52:29,912
If you could see it, well done to you.

1827
01:52:29,994 --> 01:52:32,912
This American guy said to me, he said:

1828
01:52:32,994 --> 01:52:34,745
"Hey. Hey, buddy."

1829
01:52:34,828 --> 01:52:37,078
And I'm like, "Yeah, what's up, man?"

1830
01:52:37,161 --> 01:52:40,578
He said, "How did the Troubles start?

1831
01:52:40,662 --> 01:52:42,411
Tell me, how did the Troubles start?"

1832
01:52:42,495 --> 01:52:44,119
I was like, "Well, mate,

1833
01:52:44,203 --> 01:52:46,536
the Troubles first started
when Jaime Lannister

1834
01:52:46,620 --> 01:52:48,828
pushed Bran Stark out the window."
